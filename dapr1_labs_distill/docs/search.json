One hundred participants were\nasked to decide whether a presented word was a real word or a non-word.\nThe data include 100 rows (one for each participant) and 7\nvariables:\n\nVariable Name\nDescription\nid\nParticipant ID\nage\nAge\nlanguage\nLanguage group (1 = monolingual, 2 =\nbilingual)\nrt_word\nReaction time (ms) for word trials\nrt_nonword\nReaction time (ms) for non-word\ntrials\nacc_word\nAccuracy for word trials\nacc_nonword\nAccuracy for non-word trials\n\nYou can download the data from this link: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/ldt_data.csv.\nTasks\nFor formative report A, you will be asked to perform the following\ntasks, each related to a week of teaching in this course:\nA1) Read the data into R and inspect it\nA2) Display and describe the categorical data\nA3) Display and describe the numerical data\nA4) Display and describe a relationship of interest between two or three\nvariables of your choice\nThis week you will only focus on task A1. Below\nthere are some guided sub-steps you may want to consider to complete\ntask A1.\nA1 sub-tasks\nNote: Too see the hints, hover your cursor on the\nsuperscript numbers.\nRead the lexical decision task data into R and inspect at the\ndata. By inspect, we literally mean to look at the data in RStudio. You\ndon’t need to show the full data in the report.2\nHow many observations are there?3\nHow many variables are there? 4\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nThink about it: what does dim(<dataset name>)\nreturn instead? What is the function of appending a [1] or\n[2]?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the type of each variable?5\nWhat’s the minimum and maximum age in the sample? What about the\naverage age?6\nDo you notice any issues with the ages? Look at your data and\ncome up with a possible reason why the results are strange.7\nThe language variable appears to contain numbers. Do\nthose numbers correspond to an amount or a type? Convert that variable\nto the appropriate type and provide more descriptive labels.8\nWorked Example\nA dataset with 157 observations on the following 7 variables:\nBill: Size of the bill (in dollars)\nTip: Size of the tip (in dollars)\nCredit: Paid with a credit card? n or y\nGuests: Number of people in the group\nDay: Day of the week: m=Monday, t=Tuesday, w=Wednesday,\nth=Thursday, or f=Friday\nServer: Code for specific waiter/waitress: A, B, or\nC\nPctTip: Tip as a percentage of the bill\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)   # we use read_csv and glimpse from tidyverse\n\n\n\n\ntips <- read_csv(\"https://www.lock5stat.com/datasets3e/RestaurantTips.csv\")\nhead(tips)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n   Bill   Tip Credit Guests Day   Server PctTip\n  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>   <dbl>\n1  23.7 10    n           2 f     A        42.2\n2  36.1  7    n           3 f     B        19.4\n3  32.0  5.01 y           2 f     A        15.7\n4  17.4  3.61 y           2 f     B        20.8\n5  15.4  3    n           2 f     B        19.5\n6  18.6  2.5  n           2 f     A        13.4\n\n\n\ndim(tips)\n\n[1] 157   7\n\n\n\nglimpse(tips)   # glimpse is provided by tidyverse\n\nRows: 157\nColumns: 7\n$ Bill   <dbl> 23.70, 36.11, 31.99, 17.39, 15.41, 18.62, 21.56, 19.5…\n$ Tip    <dbl> 10.00, 7.00, 5.01, 3.61, 3.00, 2.50, 3.44, 2.42, 3.00…\n$ Credit <chr> \"n\", \"n\", \"y\", \"y\", \"n\", \"n\", \"n\", \"n\", \"n\", \"n\", \"n\"…\n$ Guests <dbl> 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2,…\n$ Day    <chr> \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"f\"…\n$ Server <chr> \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\"…\n$ PctTip <dbl> 42.2, 19.4, 15.7, 20.8, 19.5, 13.4, 16.0, 12.4, 12.7,…\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\nAlternatives to glimpse:\n\n\nstr(tips)\n\nspec_tbl_df [157 × 7] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Bill  : num [1:157] 23.7 36.1 32 17.4 15.4 ...\n $ Tip   : num [1:157] 10 7 5.01 3.61 3 2.5 3.44 2.42 3 2 ...\n $ Credit: chr [1:157] \"n\" \"n\" \"y\" \"y\" ...\n $ Guests: num [1:157] 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Day   : chr [1:157] \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ Server: chr [1:157] \"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"B\" ...\n $ PctTip: num [1:157] 42.2 19.4 15.7 20.8 19.5 13.4 16 12.4 12.7 10.7 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..

The same number of\nmissing values appear for the day of the week variable. There is no\nevidence of incorrectly inputted values or striking values that may\nsuggest an alternative way of specifying missingness.\n\n Data adapted from:\nNordmann, E., McAleer, P., Toivo, W., Paterson, H. & DeBruine, L.\n(2022). Data visualisation using R, for researchers who don’t use R.\nAdvances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science. https://doi.org/10.1177/25152459221074654↩︎\n Hint:\nView(<dataset name>) or\nhead(<dataset name>)↩︎\n Hint:\nnrow(<dataset name>) or\ndim(<dataset name>)[1]↩︎\n Hint:\nncol(<dataset name>) or\ndim(<dataset name>)[2]↩︎\n Hint:\nglimpse(<dataset name>) from tidyverse,\nor str(<dataset name>), or\nsapply(<dataset name>, data.class)↩︎\n Hint:\nsummary(<data>), min(<data>),\nmax(<data>), mean(<data>)↩︎\n Can age be negative? What may that\nvalue indicate?\nAre there a possibly mistyped values?↩︎\n Hint: Sometimes numbers just\nrepresent categories and it wouldn’t make sense to perform mathematical\noperations on those labels, e.g. compute a mean. In this particular case\n1 = monolingual, 2 = bilingual. The function\nfactor(<variable>, levels = ..., labels = ...) lets\nyou specify the current levels and assign each a more informative word\nlabel. Remember, you combine different values with the c()\nfunction, e.g. c(\"a\", \"b\").↩︎\n",
