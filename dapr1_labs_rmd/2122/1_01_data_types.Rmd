__Information about solutions__

Solutions for these exercises are available immediately below each question.  
We would like to emphasise that much evidence suggests that testing enhances learning, and we __strongly__ encourage you to make a concerted attempt at answering each question *before* looking at the solutions. Immediately looking at the solutions and then copying the code into your work will lead to poorer learning.  
We would also like to note that there are always many different ways to achieve the same thing in R, and the solutions provided are simply _one_ approach.  
:::



In this lab, we are going to take a look at how to access specific sections of data, before we move on to talking about different types of data.

We encourage you to work along with the reading - open a new RMarkdown document, and run the code which we discuss below.  
   
At the end there is a set of exercises for you to complete. 


# Accessing parts of the data  

Suppose we read some data into R:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
starwars2 <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/starwars2.csv")
```

:::yellow
__Reading data from a URL__ 

Note that when you have a url for some data, such as [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/starwars2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uoepsy/data/master/starwars2.csv), you can read it in directly by giving functions like `read_csv()` the url inside quotation marks. 
:::

The data contains information on various characteristics of characters from Star Wars.
We can print out the top of the data by using the name we just gave it:  
```{r}
starwars2
```

Alternatively, you could use the `head()` function which displays the first six rows of the data by default. You could change this by saying, for example, `head(data, n = 10)`:
```{r}
head(starwars2)
```

_(Don't worry about the_ <NA>s _for now, they are just how R tells you an entry is missing, i.e. Not Available.)_  

:::green
__Tip:__ Try clicking on the data in your __environment__ (the top right window of RStudio). It will open the data in a tab in the editor window - this is another way of looking at the data, more like you would in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel.
This can be time-consuming if your data file is big.
:::

We can take a look at how big the data is (the dimensions), using `dim()`
```{r}
dim(starwars2)
```

There's a reasonable amount of data in there - `r nrow(starwars2)` rows and `r ncol(starwars2)` columns.  
In the __starwars2__ data, each character is an __observational unit__, and there are 6 __variables__ (things which vary between units) such as their _height_, _species_, _homeworld_, etc.  

:::yellow  
__Units and variables__

The individual entities on which data are collected are called __observational units__ or __cases__. Often (but not always), these equate to the rows of a dataset.  

A __variable__ is any characteristic that varies from observational unit to observational unit (these are often the columns of the dataset)
:::

What if we want to extract certain subsections of our dataset, such as specific observational units or variables? 
This is where we learn about two important bits of R code used to access parts of data - the dollar sign `$`, and the square brackets `[]`.

:::frame
__The dollar sign $__  
  
The dollar sign allows us to extract a specific variable from a dataframe.
For instance, we can pull out the variable named "eye_color" in the data, by using `$eye_color` after the name that we gave our dataframe: 
```{r}
starwars2$eye_color
```
:::

Each variable in a dataframe is a vector. Once extracted, we will have a vector and not a dataframe.

:::frame
__The square brackets []__  
  
Square brackets are used to do what is known as __indexing__ (finding specific entries in your data).  
We can retrieve bits of data by identifying the $i^{th}$ entry(s) inside the square brackets, for instance: 

```{r}
# assign the numbers 10, 20 ... 100 to the name "somevalues"
somevalues <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)

# pull out the 3rd entry
somevalues[3]
```

In the above example, we have a __vector__ (a single sequence of values), and so we can retrieve entries with the syntax:
<center> 
**vector[entry]**
</center>
<br>
In a __dataframe__ we have an extra dimension - we have rows _and_ columns. Using square brackets with a dataframe needs us to specify both:  
<center>
**dataframe[rows, columns]**
</center>
:::

Let's look at some examples: 
```{r}
# first row, fourth column:
starwars2[1, 4]

# tenth row, first column:
starwars2[10, 1]
```

<br>

If we leave either rows or columns blank, then we will get out __all__ of them: 
```{r}
# tenth row, all columns:
starwars2[10, ]

# all rows, 2nd column:
starwars2[ , 2]
```

<br>

There are is another way to identify column - we can use the name in quotation marks:
```{r}
# first row, "species" column
starwars2[1, "species"]
```
<br>
Finally, we can also ask for multiple rows, or multiple columns, or both! To do that, we use the combine function `c()`:
```{r}
# the 1st AND the 6th row, 
# and the 1st AND 3rd columns:
starwars2[c(1,6), c(1,3)]
```
<br>
And we can specify a sequence using the colon, `from:to`:  
```{r}
# FROM the 1st TO the 6th row, all columns:
starwars2[1:6, ]
```

Why? Because the colon operator, `from:to`, creates a vector from the value `from` to the value `to` in steps of 1.
```{r}
1:6
```
`r optbegin(label="Extra: Combining $ and []. Click to expand", olabel=FALSE)`
We can use the two accessors in combination: 

```{r}
# extract the variable called "name" and show the 20th entry 
starwars2$name[20]
```

This represents the 20th name in the data.

__Note:__ When we do this, we don't have the comma inside the square brackets.  
When we use the `$` to pull out a variable, such as `starwars2$name`, we no longer have a dataframe - `starwars2$name` doesn't have rows and columns, it just has a series of values - _it's a vector!_.   
So when you are using `[]` with a __vector__ (1 dimension) rather than a __dataframe__ (2 dimensions), you don't specify `[rows, columns]`, but simply `[entry]`. 
`r optend()`


:::yellow
__The dollar sign $__ 

Used to extract a variable from a dataframe:   

+ `dataframe$variable`

__The square brackets []__

Used to extract parts of an R object by identifying rows and/or columns, or more generally, "entries". Left blank will return all. 

+ `vector[entries]`
+ `dataframe[rows, columns]`
:::

## Accessing by a condition {-}  

We can also do something really useful, which is to access all the entries in the data for which _a specific condition_ is true.  

Let's take a simple example to start:
```{r}
somevalues <- c(10, 10, 0, 20, 15, 40, 10, 40, 50, 35)
```

To only select values which are greater than 20, we can use:
```{r}
somevalues[somevalues > 20]
```

Let's unpack what this is doing..  

<div style="margin-left:15px">
First, let's look at what `somevalues > 20` does. It returns TRUE for the entries of `somevalues` which are greater than 20, and FALSE for the entries of `somevalues` that are not (that is, which are less than, or equal to, 20. 

This statement `somevalues > 20` is called the __condition__.    
```{r}
somevalues > 20
```

We can give a name to this sequence of TRUEs and FALSEs
```{r}
condition <- somevalues > 20
condition
```

Now consider putting the sequence of TRUEs and FALSEs inside the square brackets in `somevalues[]`.
This returns only the entries of `somevalues` for which the condition is `TRUE`.  
```{r}
somevalues[condition]
```

So what we can do is use a __condition__ inside the square brackets to return all the values for which that condition is TRUE.

Note that you don't have to always give a name to the condition. This works too:
```{r}
somevalues[somevalues > 20]
```

</div>
<br>
We can extend this same logic to a dataframe.
Let's suppose we want to access all the entries in our Star Wars data who have the value "Droid" in the _species_ variable.
To work out how to do this, we first need a line of code which defines our __condition__ - one which returns `TRUE` for each entry of the _species_ variable which is "Droid", and `FALSE` for those that are not "Droid".  

We can use the dollar sign to pull out the _species_ variable: 
```{r}
starwars2$species
```

And we can ask R whether each value __is equal to__ "Droid" (*Remember:* in R, we ask whether something __is equal to__ something else by using a double-equals, `==`). A single equal sign would be wrong, as it denotes assignment.
```{r}
starwars2$species == "Droid"
```

Finally, we can use this condition inside our square brackets to access the entries of the data for which this condition is TRUE:
```{r}
# I would read the code below as: 

# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition starwars2$species=="Droid" is TRUE, and give me all the columns."

starwars2[starwars2$species == "Droid", ]
```

`r optbegin('Optional extra. Click to expand', FALSE)`
A useful function is `with()`. This creates a "container" where the variables of the dataframe are available to R within the `with()` parentheses without the need to use `$`:
```{r}
with(starwars2, starwars2[species == "Droid", ])
```
`r optend()`

# Editing parts of the data  

Now that we've seen a few ways of _accessing_ sections of data, we can learn how to edit them!  

:::yellow
__Data Cleaning__

One of the most common reasons you will need to modify entries in your data is in __data cleaning__. This is the process of identifying incorrect/incomplete/irrelevant data, and replacing/modifying/deleting them.  
:::

## Changing specific entries {-}  

Above, we looked at the subsection of the data where the _species_ variable had the entry "Droid". Some of you may have noticed earlier that we had some data on C3PO. Is he not also a droid? 

<center>
![](images/types_of_data/c3po.png)  
</center>

(Looks pretty Droid-y to me! _disclaimer: I know nothing about Star Wars_ &#128578; )

Just as we saw above how to _access_ specific entries, e.g.: 
```{r}
# 2nd row, all columns
starwars2[2, ]
# 2nd row, 6th column (the "species" column)
starwars2[2,6]
```

We can change these by __assigning them a new value__ (remember the `<-` symbol):
```{r}
# C3PO is a droid, not a human
starwars2[2,6] <- "Droid"

# Look at the 2nd row now -
# the entry in the "species" column has changed:
starwars2[2, ]
```

:::frame
__Think of it as "overwriting", "replacing", or "reassigning"__

We have _replaced_, or _overwritten_, the entry in the 2nd row and 6th column of the data (`starwars2[2,6]`) with the value "Droid". 
:::

## Changing entries via a condition {-}  

We saw above how to access parts of data by means of a __condition__, with code such as:

```{r}
# "In the starwars2 dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and give me all the columns."

# remember, we're asking for all the columns by leaving it blank *after* the 
# comma inside the square brackets: data[rows, columns]
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", ]
```

What if we wanted to modify it so that every character from "Naboo" was actually of species "Nabooian"?  

We can do that in a number of ways, all of which do the same thing - namely, they access parts of the data and assign them the new value "Nabooian".  

Study the lines of code below and their interpretations:  

```{r}
# In the starwars2 data, give the rows for which condition 
# starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and select only the "species" column. 
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", "species"] <- "Nabooian"

# In the starwars2 data, give the rows for which condition 
# starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE, and select only the 6th column. 
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo", 6] <- "Nabooian"

# Extract the species variable from the starwars2 data (it's a vector).
# Pick the entries for which the condition starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo" is TRUE.
# Assign to these selected entries the value "Nabooian".
starwars2$species[starwars2$homeworld=="Naboo"] <- "Nabooian"
```


## Changing a variable

Another thing we might want to do is change a whole variable (a whole column) in some way.  
The logic is the same, for instance: 
```{r}
starwars2$height <- starwars2$height / 100
```
What we have done above is taking the variable "height" from the dataframe "starwars2", dividing it by 100 via `starwars2$height / 100`, and then assigning the result to the same variable, i.e. we overwrite the column.  

Equally, we _could also have added a new column_ named "height2" with those values if you do not want to overwrite "height":
```{r eval=FALSE}
starwars2$height2 <- starwars2$height / 100
```
This would have left the "height" variable as-is, and created a new one called "height2" which was the values in "height" divided by 100. 


## Removing rows or columns

Lastly, we might want to change the data by removing a row or a column.
Again, the logic remains the same, in that we use `<-` to assign the edited data to a name (either a new name, thus creating a new object, or an existing name, thereby _overwriting_ that object).  
  
For instance, notice that the 35th and 75th rows of our data probably aren't a valid observation - I'm reasonably sure that Marge and Homer Simpson never appeared in Star Wars:
```{r}
starwars2[c(35,75), ]
```

We can remove a certain row(s) by using a minus sign `-` inside the square brackets 
```{r}
# everything minus the 75th row
starwars2[-75, ]

# everything minus the (35th and 75th rows)
starwars2[-c(35, 75), ]
```

And we can simply _re-use_ the name "starwars2" to overwrite the data and make this change take effect (rather than just print out the result, which the code above did):
```{r}
starwars2 <- starwars2[-c(35, 75), ]
```
(now, in the __environment__ pane of Rstudio, the object named "starwars2" will say 73 observations, rather than 75, which it had before - we've removed the 2 rows)   

The same logic applies for columns:
```{r}
# Create a new object called "anonymous_starwars2" and assign it 
# to the values which are the "starwars2" dataframe minus the 
# 1st column (the "name" column):
anonymous_starwars2 <- starwars2[, -1]

# print out anonymous_starwars2
anonymous_starwars2
```



# Types of data 

There are so many different things we can measure / record on observational units.
Therefore the data we collect will also have different characteristics.

For instance, we could measure the colour of people's hair as any of "black", "brown", "blond", and so on, or we could use reflective spectrophotometry to obtain a number for the black/white-ness, a number for the red/green-ness, and a number for the blue/yellow-ness. One approach gives us a set of possible categories, the other gives us numbers. We distinguish between these different types in talking about __categorical__ and __numerical__ variables. Within each, there also are a few important sub-classes.

:::yellow
__Categorical__ variables tell us what group or category each individual belongs to. Each distinct group or category is called a __level__ of the variable.
:::

|  __Type__ | __Description__ |  __Example__|
|:--|:--|:--|
|  __Nominal (Unordered categorical)__ | A categorical variable with _no_ intrinsic ordering among the levels. | Species: _Human_, _Droid_, _Wookie_, _Hutt_, ... |
|  __Ordinal (Ordered categorical)__ | A categorical variable which levels possess some kind of order |  Level: _Low_, _Medium_, _High_ |
|  __Binary categorical__ | A special case of categorical variable with only 2 possible levels |  Is_Human: _Yes_ or _No_. |

<br>

:::yellow
__Numerical__ (or quantitative) variables consist of numbers, and represent a measurable quantity. Operations like adding and averaging make sense only for numeric variables.
:::
|  __Type__ | __Description__ |  __Example__|
|:--|:--|:--|
|  __Continuous__ | Variables which can take any real number within the specified range of measurement |  Height: _172_, _165.2_, _183_, ... |
| __Discrete__ |  Variables which can only take integer number values. For instance, a _counts_ can only take positive integer values (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) | Number_of_siblings: _0_, _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, ... |

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ahorst/nominal_ordinal_binary.png")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Artwork by \\@allison_horst"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ahorst/continuous_discrete.png")
```




In R, different types of data get treated differently by functions, and we need to tell R explicitly what type of data each variable is.  

Think about why we have to do this. All that data is, at its most fundamental level, is a set of symbols: e.g. "a", "14", etc. 
We need to tell R if our set of symbols "1", "4", "5" are _numbers_ - and so can be added/subtracted etc - or if they correspond to _categories_. Alternatively, they might be neither, and just be a set of _characters_ (symbols). 
  
We can use some specific functions to both _tell_ and _ask_ R what type some data are:  

|  __Type__|  __Set as...__|  __Check is...__|
|:--|:--|:--|
|  __Categorical__|  `as.factor()`<br>`factor()`|  `is.factor()`|
|  __Ordered Categorical (Ordinal)__ | `as.ordered()`<br>`factor(... , ordered = TRUE)` | `is.ordered()` |
|  __Continuous__|  `as.numeric()`|  `is.numeric()`|
|  __Character__|  `as.character()`|  `is.character()`|

<br>
    
To check whether variables of a certain type, we can use these functions as follows:
```{r}
is.character(starwars2$name)
is.numeric(starwars2$height)
is.factor(starwars2$species)
```

Alternatively, we can also use the function `class()`:
```{r}
class(starwars2$height)
```

And we can modify the class of a variable by following the same syntax as we modified variables earlier, and using functions such as `as.factor()`, `as.numeric()`:
```{r}
# overwrite the "species" variable with a 'factorised' "species" variable:
starwars2$species <- as.factor(starwars2$species)
```

Check that it is now a factor:
```{r}
class(starwars2$species)
```

Factors have certain __levels__ that values can take:  
```{r}
levels(starwars2$species)
```
 
:::yellow
__Levels__  

In categorical data, each case has a value which is one of a fixed set of possibilities. The set of possibilities are the __levels__ of a categorical variable.  
:::

If we were to try and set an entry as a value which is not one of those levels, it won't work, and you'll likely get an error such as: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
# set the 1st row, 6th column (the species variable) to be "Peppapig"
starwars2[1, 6] <- "Peppapig"
```
<div style="margin-left:20px">
<p style="color:red">invalid factor level, NA generated</p>
<p style="color:red">Error: Assigned data `"Peppapig"` must be compatible with existing data.</p>
</div>
  
One useful function which treats different classes of variable differently, is `summary()`.  
Notice how the output differs between variables such as _height_, which we know is numeric, _species_, which we just set to be categorical, and _homeworld_ which is currently character (just text):  
```{r}
summary(starwars2)
```

`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The _strength_cat_ variable indicates the strength of the password, and can take one of three values: "weak", "medium", and "strong".  
These are __categories__, but they _have a natural ordering_ (weak < medium < strong).  

Unfortunately, if we just use `as.ordered()`, we don't get the correct ordering (see the bottom of the output, where it tells us the levels).  
(We're not going to assign this right now as we just want to print out what it would look like)
```{r}
# show the "strength_cat" variable in the pwords dataframe 
# when turned into a factor (categorical), in which the 
# categories are ordered
as.ordered(pwords$strength_cat)
```

This is because R will, _by default_, use alphabetical ordering.   

What we can do is use the `factor()` function, with extra settings of `ordered=TRUE`, and by defining the levels (and thus also defining the ordering): 
```{r}
# show the "strength_cat" variable in the pwords dataframe when 
# turned into a factor (categorical), in which the possible 
# categories are "weak","medium", and "strong", and the categories 
# are ordered (in the above order). 
factor(pwords$strength_cat, levels=c("weak","medium","strong"), ordered=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# REASSIGN the "strength_cat" variable in the pwords dataframe as 
# a factor, with the ordered categories "weak","medium" and "strong".
pwords$strength_cat <- factor(pwords$strength_cat, levels = c("weak","medium","strong"), ordered = TRUE)

# check the levels of the variable
levels(pwords$strength_cat)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("10 - Harder")`
Show all the data for passwords categorised as __either__ "animal" __or__ "sport".  
  
Note that this requires something which we didn't mention above. 
In R, when you have multiple conditions (e.g, A _and_ B, C _or_ D), we can define them using: 

+ `&` to mean "and"
+ `|` to mean "or"

For instance, if we want to show the passwords which are  
1. categorised as "fluffy" 
__AND__
2. ranked in the top 50
```{r}
# "In the pwords dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# conditions pwords$type == "fluffy" AND pwords$rank <= 50 are TRUE, 
# and give me all the columns."
pwords[(pwords$type == "fluffy") & (pwords$rank <= 50), ]
```
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
# "In the pwords dataframe, give me all the rows for which
# either of the conditions pwords$type=="animal" OR pwords$type=="sport" is TRUE, 
# and give me all the columns."
pwords[(pwords$type == "animal") | (pwords$type == "sport"), ]
```
`r solend()`

---

`r qbegin("11 - Harder")`
Finally, show all the data for which the passwords are __not__ categorised as "fluffy". 

_Recall_ from the [introductory to R page](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr1/labs/00_intro.html), that in R we use an exclamation mark, `!`, to mean "not". 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We can actually do this two ways, either by:

+ using `!=` to set the condition to be where the "type" variable is __not equal to__ (`!=`) "fluffy".  
+ using `==` to set the condition where the "type" variable __equal to__ (`==`) "fluffy", and putting the __not__ (`!`) around it. 

They will both do the same thing: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# "In the pwords dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition pwords$type!="fluffy" is TRUE,
# and give me all the columns."
pwords[pwords$type != "fluffy", ]

# "In the pwords dataframe, give me all the rows for which the
# condition pwords$type=="fluffy" is FALSE,
# and give me all the columns."
pwords[!(pwords$type == "fluffy"), ]
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
pwords[!(pwords$type == "fluffy"), ]
```
`r solend()`
