# In this intro...
+ The dapR team

--

  + Plus a few course details

--

+ dapR and life

--

+ Expectations

--

+ What each week will look like.


---
# dapR Team

---
# dapR 1 
+ In dapR1, we will teach you how to...

--

  + Deal with data in R

--
  + tidy it, manipulate it and transform it,
  
--

  + visualise it, and

--

  + a little bit of analysing it.


---
# dapR 1: Aims
+ Build the core data and R skills.
    + And to do so at a slow and steady pace.

+ Introduce some key statistical concepts.

+ To help you develop an effective approach to studying data analysis.

+ To encourage you as a cohort to be collaborative, supportive peers.

+ To integrate with Psychology 1A and 1B.


---
# What is R? 
+ A very flexible, free, programming language for all things data.
  + It does pretty much any statistical method you can think of. (Cool? I think so)
  + But it does a lot more.

---
# What is R? 
+ Some examples:
  + [interactive plots](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html) 
  + [interactive dashboards](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/086-bus-dashboard/) 
  + Documents with automatically include results from analysis
  + [books](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/)
  + [websites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
  + Presentations (like the one you are looking at)


---
# dapR 1: Structure
+ We are on-line, so this will look a little different to normal.

--

+ **Lectures**
  + Equivalent of ~1hr of live lecture, broken into shorter chunks
  + The chunks will be linked with tasks.

--

+ **Independent study labs**
  + Structured reading and exercises with R
  + Equivalent of ~2-3 hrs per week

--

+ **Supported by**
  + In person on-line office hours (see LEARN for times)
  + Discussion boards

???
+ Requires you to work steadily and consistently across the year. 
+ It builds, and it is hard to cram.
+ To help you build this study skills, course has a specific assessment structure.


---
# dapR 1: Assessment 
+ **Weekly quizzes** (20%)
  + 16 quizzes in total 
  + Quizzes 1 and 2 are practices.
  + The rest comprise your grade.
  + Mark is the average of your best 12/14 scores.

--

+ **Lab tests** (30%)
  + Test 1 is practice
  + Tests 2-4 count (10% each)

--

+ **Coursework report** (50%)
  + Organise some data, produce some plots, run and interpret some analysis.

???
Key point to make is the little and often principle


---
# Materials
+ All of your materials for each week will be within the weekly folders on LEARN.

--

+ It will contain:
  + A playlist of recordings
  + Slide decks
  + Links to lab material
  + Links to the weekly quizzes
  + Any comments or specific instructions for the week
  + Links to discussion boards
  + Reading (all freely available online)

--

+ The weekly folders will become available incrementally.

---
# What you can expect from us
1. We will work hard to help you learn.

2. We will be open and communicate with you.

3. We will be polite, respectful and treat you like adults.


---
# What we expect of you
1. You work hard.

2. That you talk to me and the teaching team.

---
# A brief word on engagement
+ It is going to be a different year for everyone

--

+ We are very keen to make sure everyone succeeds. 

--

+ To do that, we need to know when people are struggling. 

--

+ We will keep an eye on this in a number of ways:
  + Presence in OH
  + Engagement with material (watching recordings, discussion boards etc.)
  + Weekly quiz performance.
