# Learning objectives

- Be able to interpret type I and type II errors in hypothesis tests.

- Recognising the significance level as measuring the tolerable chance of committing a type I error.

- Understand that statistical significance is not always the same as practical significance.

- Recognise that larger sample sizes make it easier to achieve statistical significance if the alternative hypothesis is true.

# Part A
## Type I and type II errors


---

# Where we're going to


- Hypothesis testing lets us determine whether an observed effect is real or just due to random sampling variation.

--

- However, statistical significance sometimes may lead us to wrong conclusions!

--

- It is possible to make two kinds of wrong decisions:

--

  - rejecting a true null hypothesis 
  
--

  - not rejecting a false null hypothesis

--

- This week we will discuss common pitfalls of hypothesis testing, and which are the factors that influence the chances of these errors occurring.




---

# Types of errors

- Whether your decision is either to reject the null hypothesis or to not reject the null hypothesis, you might be making an error.

--

- The reasoning of hypothesis tests often is compared to that of a court trial. The possibilities in such a trial are given in the following diagram.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/ht-errors-trial.png')
```

--

- In our system of justice, convicting an innocent person is considered worse than letting a guilty person go.

---

# Types of errors

- Similarly, there are two types of errors in hypothesis testing.

  - You could convict an innocent (true) null hypothesis
  
  - You could fail to convict a guilty (false) null hypothesis

--

- Like convicting an innocent person, the error of rejecting a true null hypothesis is considered serious, and so a null hypothesis isn't rejected unless the evidence against it is convincing beyond a reasonable doubt.

# What to consider when you reject $H_0$

.pull-left[
If you reject the null hypothesis, there are two possibilities to consider:

- You are making the correct decision. The null hypothesis isn't true, and that's why the observed statistic was so far from the hypothesised value.

- You are making a type I error: rejecting $H_0$ even though $H_0$ is actually true. It was just bad luck that resulted in the observed statistic being so far from the hypothesised value. In other words, a rare event occurred.

# The probability of committing a type I error

.pull-left[
**Suppose the null hypothesis is true**

What is the chance that you will reject it, making a type I error?

The only way you can make a type I error is for your observed statistic to be a rare event.

For example, if you are using a threshold of 0.05 for the significance level $\alpha$, you would make a type I error if your p-value is less than 0.05.

When the null hypothesis is true, this happens only $\alpha = 5\%$ of the time.

# The probabilities

**Probability of Type I error**

> The significance level $\alpha$ represents the tolerable probability of committing a type I error

> $$\alpha = P(\text{Reject } H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is true}) = P(\text{Type I error})$$

> If you are worried about committing a Type I error, then your best strategy is to have a low significance level.


**Probability of Type II error**

> The probability of committing a type II error is denoted 
$$\beta = P(\text{Do not reject } H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is false}) = P(\text{Type II error})$$

> If the null hypothesis is false, setting a low significance level increases the probability of making a Type II error.


---

# Power

The power of a test is the probability that the test correctly rejects a **false** null hypothesis.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Power} 
&= P(\text{Reject }H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is false}) \\
&= 1 - P(\text{Do not reject }H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is false}) \\
&= 1 - \beta
\end{aligned}
$$

<br>

Recall, instead, that the probability of rejecting a **true** null hypothesis is the significance level:

$$
\alpha = P(\text{Reject }H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is true})
$$
Do not confuse the two!

# Factors affecting power

- Power increases as the sample size increases, all else being held constant. 

  This is because the distributions of the sample statistics become "narrower", and there will be less statistics on the left of the critical value.

--

- Power increases as the value of $\alpha$ increases, all else being held constant.

--

- Power increases when the true value of the parameter is farther from the hypothesised value in the null.
  
  When the true value of the parameter is farther from the hypothesised value in the null hypothesis, the statistics tend to be farther from the null parameter, so the p-value tends to be smaller.
  
--

You cannot change the effect size, so you can increase power by either taking a larger sample size, or making $\alpha$ larger (the latter however is not good practice).

# Significance level and errors


**IDEALLY**

While we wish to avoid both types of errors ...

--

**IN REALITY**

... in reality we have to accept some trade-off between them. 

--

- If we make it very hard to reject $H_0$, we could reduce the chance of making a Type I error, but then we would make Type II errors more often. 

- On the other hand, making it easier to reject $H_0$ would reduce the chance of making a Type II error, but increase the chance of making a Type I error and we would end up rejecting too many $H_0$'s that were actually true. 

- This balance is set by how easy or hard it is to reject $H_0$, which is exactly determined by the significance level!

# Part B
## Example where a type II error is worse


---

# Parallel in medicine


- Consider the following simple example in medical testing:

  Null: Patient doesn't have a specific illness

  Alternative: Patient has the illness

--

- a **Type I error** = a **False Positive**: 
  
  a test that indicates a patient has an illness when actually it is not present.

--

- a **Type II error** = a **False Negative**:
  
  a test that indicates the patient does not have an illness when in fact they do have it. That is, a test that fails to detect an actual illness.




---

# Power

The power of a test is the probability that the test correctly rejects a false null hypothesis.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Power} 
&= P(\text{Reject }H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is false}) \\
&= P(\text{Test positive} \mid \text{Patient truly has the illness})
\end{aligned}
$$

Power = **Sensitivity**!


--

Sensitivity = Probability of correctly diagnosing a patient as having the disease when they truly have it.

# Testing for diabetes

Recall this?

> A standard test for diabetes is based on measuring glucose levels in blood after a patient has been told to fast for a certain amount of time. For healthy people the mean glucose level after fasting is found to be 5.31 mmol/L with a standard deviation of 0.58 mmol/L. For untreated diabetics the mean is 11.74 mmol/L, and the standard deviation is 3.50 mmol/L. The distribution of fasting glucose levels in both groups appears to be approximately normally distributed.

> To carry out a clinical test based on fasting glucose levels, we need to set a cutoff point, $C$, so that if the patient‚Äôs glucose level after fasting is at least $C$ we say they have diabetes. If it is lower than the cutoff point, we can say they do not have diabetes. Suppose we use $C = 6.5$.

pvalue
```

# Average body temperature

- At a significance level of 5%, the very small p-value we have found, 0.002 < 0.05, gives very strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the average body temperature for healthy humans is 37 ¬∞C.

--

- However, it is worth noting the difference between **statistical significance** and practical significance. 

--

- Even if the sample results lead to convincingly rejecting the null hypothesis, assuming the average body temperature for healthy humans to be closer to 36.8 ¬∞C rather than 37 ¬∞C has a very minimal impact in practice. 

--

- More generally, with large sample sizes a small difference might turn out to be statistically significant. However, this does not mean that the difference will be of practical importance to decision-makers.

Effects of Sample Size

- With a small sample size, it may be hard to find significant results, even when the alternative hypothesis is true.

- With a large sample size, it is easier to find significant results when the alternative hypothesis is true, but we should be especially careful to distinguish between statistical significance and practical significance.
