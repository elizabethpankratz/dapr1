# Activity

For each of the following questions of interest formally state the null and alternative hypotheses using symbols.

1. Are children with higher exposure to pesticides more likely to develop ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)? 

1. Is the average age of ICU patients at this hospital greater than 50?

1. When getting voters to support a candidate in an election, is there a difference between a recorded phone call from the candidate or a flyer about the candidate sent through the mail?

1. Does this new allergy medication really reduce symptoms more than a placebo? 

1. If you want to remember something, does taking a nap work better than having some caffeine?

# Answers

1. Are children with higher exposure to pesticides more likely to develop ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder)? 

    $$
    H_0: p_{\text{exposed}} = p_{\text{not exposed}} \\
    H_1: p_{\text{exposed}} > p_{\text{not exposed}}
    $$  
    where $p$ is the proportion of children diagnosed with ADHD.
    
    Alternatively,
    
    $$
    H_0: p_{\text{exposed}} - p_{\text{not exposed}} = 0 \\
    H_1: p_{\text{exposed}} - p_{\text{not exposed}} > 0
    $$  
    
1. Is the average age of ICU patients at this hospital greater than 50?

    $$
    H_0 : \mu = 50 \\
    H_1 : \mu > 50
    $$  
    where $\mu$ is the population mean age in the hospital's ICU unit.

1. When getting voters to support a candidate in an election, is there a difference between a recorded phone call from the candidate or a flyer about the candidate sent through the mail?

    $$
    H_0 : p_{\text{call}} = p_{\text{flyer}} \\
    H_1 : p_{\text{call}} \neq p_{\text{flyer}}
    $$  
    where $p$ is the proportion of votes for that candidate.
    
    Alternatively:
    $$
    H_0 : p_{\text{call}} - p_{\text{flyer}} = 0 \\
    H_1 : p_{\text{call}} - p_{\text{flyer}} \neq 0
    $$  

1. Does this new allergy medication really reduce symptoms more than a placebo? 

    $$
    H_0 : p_{\text{medication}} = p_{\text{placebo}} \\
    H_1 : p_{\text{medication}} < p_{\text{placebo}}
    $$  
    where $p$ is the proportion of people that develop symptoms.
    
    Alternatively:
    
    $$
    H_0 : p_{\text{medication}} - p_{\text{placebo}} = 0\\
    H_1 : p_{\text{medication}} - p_{\text{placebo}} < 0
    $$

1. If you want to remember something, does taking a nap work better than having some caffeine?
    
    $$
    H_0 : \mu_{\text{nap}} = \mu_{\text{caffeine}} \\
    H_1 : \mu_{\text{nap}} > \mu_{\text{caffeine}}
    $$  
    where $\mu$ is the average number of items remembered from a list (that the researcher has developed and used for testing the participants).
    
    Alternatively:
    
    $$
    H_0 : \mu_{\text{nap}} - \mu_{\text{caffeine}} = 0\\
    H_1 : \mu_{\text{nap}} - \mu_{\text{caffeine}} > 0
    $$
