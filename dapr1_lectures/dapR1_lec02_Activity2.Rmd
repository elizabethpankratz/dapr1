b. mystery
c. thriller
d. comedy

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

set.seed(106)
df1 <- tibble(
    dat = rmultinom(1, size = 120, prob = c(0.1,0.1,0.3, 0.5))
)

df1 %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=Degree)) +
    geom_bar(fill="steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "Favourite type of fiction", y = "Count") +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("historical", "mystery", "thriller", "comedy"))
```



# Barplot 2

What is the median of the following small data set?
dat = [1,5,6,3,76,2,6,8,98,5]

a. The values of the variable of interest. 
b. The frequency of the variable of interest. 
c. The average value of the variable
d. Both a and b. 

# Answers
1. d
2. 8.5 
dat = [1,5,6,3,76,2,6,8,98,5]
sorted dat = [1,2,3,7,8,9,9,24,76,98]
length = 10
median value = (10+1)/2 = 5.5
5th value = 8, 6th value = 9
median = (8+9)/2 = 8.5
