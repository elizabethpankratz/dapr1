## Question

Let's try playing around a little bit with the PDF for the normal distribution. In the next section of the lecture, we'll learn some useful R code for getting us the same results, but for now let's use the below code. 

The code: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mu = 0
sigma = 1
x = 2
my_output = (1/(sigma*sqrt(2*pi)))*(exp(-(x-mu)^2/(2*sigma^2)))
```

This code translates the equation: 
$$
f(x|\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$
Into R code. 

Try substituting different values for the variables, x, mu, and sigma. How does the result of the formula change as x becomes closer and farther from mu when you hold sigma constant? How does the output for a constant x and mu change as you increase and decrease sigma? Can you play around with all the variable and get a feeling for how they affect the output of the equation?
