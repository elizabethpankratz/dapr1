# Course aims

<!-- + With big data, no one does the calculations with a pocket calculator. Instead, they use software such as R. -->

+ Build the core data and R skills at a slow and steady pace.

+ Introduce key statistical concepts.

+ Help you develop an effective approach to studying data analysis.

+ Encourage you as a cohort to be collaborative, supportive peers.

+ Integrate with Psychology 1A and 1B.


---
# What is R? 

+ A very flexible, free, programming language for working with data

  + It does pretty much any statistical method you can think of
  
  + But it does a lot more

# Interactive plots

For example: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html

```{r echo=F, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/dapr-intro-plot.png')
```


---
# Interactive dahsboards

For example: https://gallery.shinyapps.io/086-bus-dashboard/

```{r echo=F, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/dapr-intro-dash.png')
```

---
# Reports

- Documents which automatically include results from analysis

- We will create these in the labs

---
# Books

For example: https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/

```{r echo=F, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/dapr-intro-book.png')
```

# Websites

For example: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

```{r echo=F, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}

# Presentations

Like the one you are looking at.


---
# Expectations

The course is delivered in person, and __you are expected to attend lectures and labs.__

--

+ **Two lectures each week**
  
  + The first is on Mondays, the second is on Tuesdays.

--

+ **Lecture activities or readings**
  
  + Each week you may be assigned activities or readings, and you are expected to complete those.

--

+ **Labs with tutors**
  
  + Group-based practical sessions
  + Goal is preparing you to analyse real data and write up reports
  + They involve a set of structured tasks to be solved with the help of R
  + 1 hr per week
  + Will require you to produce and submit formative assessments as a group

---
# Help and Support

+ **Labs** (see your timetable for the time)

    + Ask tutors for help on R, lab materials, concepts from the lectures
    
+ **Discussion forum** (see LEARN for link)

    + Write your questions to get answers from instructors and other students

+ **Office hours** (see LEARN for details)

    + 1:1 support sessions with an instructor
    
+ **Personal tutor**
    
    + For 1:1 support about the wider degree and the university in general, you should also meet with your personal tutor (PT)


---
# Important

+ The course requires you to work steadily and consistently across the year. 

+ Each week's content builds on the previous weeks, so it is cumulative.

+ It requires regular studying and keeping up to date. It is not designed for leaving everything to last minute all-night studying before assessments.

+ To help you build study skills, the course has a specific assessment structure which integrates multiple formative assessments.

    - This creates an interative improvement path.


---
# Assessment 

The final grade is divided into different components: 

- 40% from coursework (weekly quizzes and report)
- 60% from the final exam

---
# Assessment: Coursework

+ **Weekly quizzes** (10%)

  + 14 quizzes in total
  + Quizzes 1 and 2 are practice quizzes
  + The remaining are used towards your grade
  + Mark is the average of your best 10/14 scores

--

+ **Report** (30%)

  + In semester 2
  + Format: each group will be given data and a set of tasks, and you will be required to write up your analysis
  + Multiple opportunities to practice during the labs

---
# Assessment: Final exam

+ **In-person exam** (60%)
  
  + After semester 2
  + Different formats of questions
  + Details to be announced closer to the new year


---
# Materials

+ Each week's material will be within a weekly folder on LEARN containing:
  
  + Weekly quiz
  + Slide decks
  + Lecture activities or readings
  + Lab exercises
  + Discussion forum

--

+ You must still go to the lectures and labs in person!

--

+ The weekly folders will become available incrementally, and the top one is always the one for the current week.
