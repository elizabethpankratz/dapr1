# Week's Learning Objectives
1. Understand the key difference between discrete and continuous probability distributions.
2. Apply understanding of continuous probability distributions to the example of a normal distribution.
3. Understand how to use a range from a continuous probability distribution. 
4. Introduce other continuous probability distributions. 

---
## Discrete vs. continuous
- Recall that a _discrete probability distribution_ describes a random variable that produces a discrete set of outcomes. 

--

- By contrast, a _continuous probability distribution_ describes a random variable that produces a continuous set of outcomes 

  - Temperature
  - Height
  - Reaction Time

- If you have arbitrary precision of measurement, you have a continuous random variable.

--

- As a result, while a discrete probability distribution is jagged, a continuous probability distribution is smooth.

## Discrete vs. continuous

- Continuous probability distributions differ from discrete in two other important ways. 
    - $P(X=x)=0$

  - Continuous probability distributions are described using the **probability density function (PDF)**, rather than the **probability mass function**.

--

- Now, let's take a look at perhaps the most widely used continuous probability distribution... 

---
class: center, middle

## Questions?

---
## Normal distribution

.pull-left[
- A **normal distribution** (AKA the Gaussian distribution) is a continuous distribution.


- It is uni-modal (one peak) and symmetrical.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = F, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-4, 4)), aes(x = x)) +
        stat_function(fun = dnorm) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
```
]

---
## Normal: PDF

$$
f(x;\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

- A bit scary!

- But the basic points are:
  
  - It is a function of data *x*
  - And *two* parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ (mean and SD)

--

- There is not one single normal distribution.
- We have a family of different distributions that are defined by their mean, $\mu$, and standard deviation, $\sigma$. 


---
## The Standard Normal Distribution

- The **standard normal distribution** is a normal distribution where $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$

.center[
```{r, echo = F, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
normDist <- ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-6, 6)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun=dnorm, geom = "line", linewidth = 1.5) + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = 'bold'))

normDist + geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 'dashed', colour = 'red')
```
]

---
## Different Normal Distributions - Adjusting $\mu$

- Adjusting $\mu$ changes where the curve is centered on the $x$-axis

                linewidth = 1.5) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,

                linewidth = 1.5) +
  annotate(geom='text', label=paste0('mu == -2'), parse = T, 
           x=-4.75, y=0.38, size = 6, colour = baseColor, hjust = 0) +

## Questions?


---
## Using the PDF of the normal distribution
- Let's use the normal distribution to illustrate how continuous probability distributions work. 

--

- With a discrete random variable it makes sense to ask: 'what's the probability associated with a specific value of the random variable?'.
  - e.g., what the probability of getting heads on a fair coin? 

--

- With a continuous random variable it makes sense to ask about ranges of scores
  - e.g., what's the probability of sampling someone between 1.6 and 1.7 meters tall if we sample students from a university?

  + $\mu = `r heightMean`$ cm

- We get the area under a curve by calculating an integral
  
  $$\int_{a}^{b} f(a) \,dx$$
  
  + Don't worry, you don't need to know the details of integrals, but you may encounter the equation above.
  
  - This equation can be read as: The integral of values falling between vertical lines $a$ and $b$ on the function $a$ of variable $x$ 
  
  - We can calculate this value using the probability density function...

## Using the PDF of the normal distribution
- What if I wanted to know where the 5% of the most extreme values (i.e., smallest and largest) in this distribution fall? 

--
  
   - The normal distribution is symmetric, which means that there are the same number of extreme values at the bottom and top end. 

--

   - This means the most extreme 5% will be the 2.5% at the bottom of the distribution and the 2.5% at the top. 

--

   - So our question is: what is the height below which there are only 2.5% of students, and what is the height above which there are only 2.5% of students? 

---
## Using the PDF of the normal distribution
.pull-left[

- To get these values, you can use `qnorm(x, mean, sd)`

- For a normally distributed range of heights with a mean of `r heightMean` cm and a sd of `r heightSD` cm: 

- The height below which 2.5% of students fall: 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
qnorm(.025, mean=168, sd=7.5)
```

- The height above which 2.5% of students fall: 
```{r, eval=TRUE}
qnorm(.975, mean=168, sd=7.5)
```

## Take this knowledge forward

+ These examples might seem a bit bizarre (when will you ever need to calculate extreme heights?), but this will be incredibly relevant when you discuss:

  + 1- and 2-tailed distributions
  + $p$ -values
  + Distributions of test statistics
    
+ You may find it helpful to come back and review these slides when you get to these topics later in the course.

## Remember $z$-scores

.pull-left[
.center[
$$
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$
]
- It is quite typical to present a normal distribution in terms of ** $z$-scores**.
- $z$-scores standardize values of $x$.
  - The numerator: converts $x$ to deviations from the mean.
  - The denominator: scales these values based on the observed spread in the data (SD)
- The result is the **standard normal distribution**, also known as the $z$-distribution

## Standard normal vs. $t$ distribution
.pull-left[

- There are other continuous probability distributions you'll be working with next semester, such as the  $t$-distribution 
- The $t$ distribution is a bit like the $z$-distribution, but the shape differs slightly. 
  - When calculating $t$, we replace $\sigma$ with $sd$.
  - As a result, the tails of the $t$-distribution are slightly higher to account for extra variability, or uncertainty from using an estimate ( $sd$ ) rather than the actual population value ( $\sigma$ )
