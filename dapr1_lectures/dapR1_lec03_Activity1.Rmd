# Bins activity 

We talked about how the size of bins can have an effect on the shape of a histogram. Below is some code that will create a sample data set for you and then make a histogram with 20 bins. Open up the slides associated with this activity and copy and paste the code into your R terminal. Change the number of bins. Try different values close to 20 and see how the shape of the histogram is affected. Try extreme values (like 2 bins or 1000 bins). What happens to the histogram? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F,warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(10)

dat1 = round(rnorm(20, 20, 10),2)
dat2 = round(rnorm(20, 60, 10),2)
mydat = c(dat1,dat2)

hist_dat <- tibble(
  scores = mydat
)

hist_dat %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x=scores)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white", fill = "steelblue4") +
    labs(x = "score (seconds)", y = "Count")
```
