```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This week's topic is describing continuous data. We will again use the dataset from last week's lecture. First we will load "tidyverse", and read the data into R, and name it "ex1".

```{r, results="hide"}
library(tidyverse)
ex1 <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/ex1.csv")
```
