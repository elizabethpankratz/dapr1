# Welcome
```{r welcome, echo=FALSE}
cohort <- 2019
team <- c("Tom", "Anastasia", "Emma" , "Esperanza", 
          "Carolane", "Catherine", "Abby", "Svenja",
          "Yangzi", "Diana")

```

We (`r team`) would like to start off by welcoming you, the cohort of `r cohort` to the dapR1. We will be with you for `r lecture_hours` hours of lectures and `r lab_hours` hours of labs across the whole of the academic year.

## Today
- dapR and your degree
    - Plus a few course details
- dapR and life
- Expectations
- *We will talk about the overall research process and measurement next lecture*

## Learning objectives
- Understand how dapR1 fits into the psychology degree
- Understand the basic structure of the course
- Understand the way in which learning from this course fits into the data analysis process

## Intro to us....
- Tom: CO, lecturer 
- Anastasia: Senior Teaching coordinator - the boss of labs (*really just the boss*)
- Wonderful lab tutors:
    - Emma 
    - Esperanza 
    - Carolane 
    - Catherine 
    - Abby 
    - Svenja 
    - Yangzi 
    - Diana 
    
## Where does dapR1 fit? {data-background-size="contain" data-background-transition="fade" data-background="timeline1.png"}

## dapR 1 {data-transition="slide-in fade-out" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="slide" data-background="tile01.png"}

- New course for 2019-20 (*in response to student feedback*)
- dapR courses (1, 2 & 3) are replacing the RMS courses.
- In dapR1, we will teach you how to...
    - get data into R,
    - tidy it, manipulate it and transform it,
    - visualise it, and
    - a little bit of analysing it.
- Important skills for psychology and life.

## dapR 1: Aims {data-transition="fade" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="none" data-background="tile01.png"}

- Build the core data and R skills.
    - And to do so at a slow and steady pace.
- Introduce some key statistical concepts.
- To help you develop an effective approach to studying data analysis.
- To encourage you as a cohort to be collaborative, supportive peers.
- To integrate with Psychology 1A and 1B.

## dapR 1: Structure {data-transition="fade" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="none" data-background="tile01.png"}
- 1x 1 hour lecture per week (Theory).
- 1x 2 hour lab per week (Practical).
- Plus some reading;
    - This will appear on LEARN and linked on top of each lab.
    - Quite low volume (but we can provide more if you would like it). 
    - We want you to spend time practising skills.
    
## dapR 1: Assessment {data-transition="fade" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="none" data-background="tile01.png"}

- Weekly quizzes (30%)
    - Quizzes 1 and 2 are practices.
    - Quizzes 3 to 20 count.
    - Mark is the average of your best 14/18 scores.
- 3 lab tests (30%; 10% each)
    - 5 questions that require code to answer
    - Completed in lab
- Coursework report (40%)
    - Organise some data, produce some plots, run and interpret some analysis.

## What is R? {data-transition="fade" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="none" data-background="tile01.png"}

- A very flexible, very cool, programming language for all things data.
    - It does pretty much any statistical method you can think of. (Cool? I think so)
    - But it does a lot more.
- We will also begin to teach you Rmarkdown - this is a cool way to integrate text and analysis

## What is R? {data-transition="fade" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="none" data-background="tile01.png"}
- Some examples:
    - [interactive plots](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html)
    - [interactive dashboards](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/086-bus-dashboard/) 
    - Documents with automatically include results from analysis

## Remember this...
```{r echo=FALSE}
cohort <- 2019
team <- c("Tom", "Anastasia", "Emma" , "Esperanza", 
          "Carolane", "Catherine", "Abby", "Svenja",
          "Yangzi", "Diana")
lecture_hours <- 10+10
lab_hours <- 20+20
```

- But what is best of all is it is completely free.
- You can go and download the R-code that made everything I just showed you.
- There is a massive R community, and a world of resources and help.

## Where does dapR1 fit? {data-background-size="contain" data-background-transition="none" data-background="timeline1.png"}

## dapR 2 {data-transition="slide" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="slide" data-background="tile02.png"}

- dapR 2 will build on the core skills developed in dapR 1.
- Major focus here is on analyzing data.
- We will cover a majority of the analytic techniques used in psychological science.
    - BUT importantly we will integrate into a single framework
- This course will have more *individual*  assessment.

## dapR 3 {data-transition="slide" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="slide" data-background="tile03.png"}

- Honours level data analysis course.
- Theoretical focus: some advanced models and thinking critically about statistics.
- Practical focus: taking real data, in the form it comes from the tools we use to do our studies.
- Then using the skills we have built up to answer questions, and report the answers in a variety of formats.

## Mini Dissertation {data-transition="slide" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="slide" data-background="tile04.png"}

- Then you do this for real!
- Year 3 mini-dissertation is a group research project with a member of faculty.
- Now you can apply the skills to your own project, with a group to help problem solve.

## The real thing {data-transition="slide" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="slide" data-background="tile05.png"}

- Then in year 4, you will have the real deal dissertation.
    - Well, for those of you who stay with psych.
- A real project you can really take ownership of.

## Life {data-transition="slide-in fade-out" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="slide" data-background="tile06.png"}

- And once all that is done, it may be time to face down life.
- But don't think you will leave these skills behind.
- My last 3 months....

## Life {data-transition="fade-in slide-out" data-background-size="cover" data-background-transition="slide" data-background="tile06.png"}

- Oh and ££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££££
- Well I can't really promise this, but data science and highly numerate jobs tend to pay pretty well!
