# Question 1
Could the following statement be correct?  
$P(x) = 1.02$

# Question 2  
There are four events $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.  
$P(A)=0.2$, $P(B)=0.4$, $P(C)=0.15$, $P(D)=0.25$.  
Could any other events be possible? How do you know? 

# Question 3
There are two events $A$, and $B$  
$P(A) =0.4$ and $P(B)=0.2$ and $P(A) \bigcup P(B) = .5$.  
Are $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive? How do you know?

# Answers 

1. False  
2. No other events are possible because $P(A)+P(B)+P(C)+P(D)=1.0$  
3. They are not mutually exclusive because if they were the probability of their union would be the sum of their probabilities. However, the probability of their union is less than the sum of their probabilities.
