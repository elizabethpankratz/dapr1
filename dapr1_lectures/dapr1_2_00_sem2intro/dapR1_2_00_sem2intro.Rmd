# Formative report C (S2 Weeks 1-5)

- Group-based report, as in the previous two practice reports

- This is the last practice report

- You must have joined a group by the end of week 3. No group changes allowed after week 3.

---

# Assessed report (S2 Weeks 6-10)

- The assessed report is worth 30% of final DAPR1 grade

- To be done in groups (same groups as Formative Report C)

- Only one person per group submits on behalf of the entire group

- No extensions allowed as this is group work based

- **Due: 12 noon, Friday 28th March 2025**

- Once the report has been graded, **each student's grade will be adjusted (up or down) based on their contribution as rated by their peers.** 

    <!-- - The adjustment will be up to 20% of the report grade.  -->

- Don't plagiarise!

    + You cannot share information with a different group
    + You cannot share code with a different group
    + You cannot use code from another group and add your own write-up
    + You cannot plagiarise example solutions

# Final Exam Information

**In Flexible Learning Week, we will release a folder on LEARN called "Final Exam Information":**

We will post there:

- Equation sheet (released in FLW)

    - Familiarise yourself with the equation sheet, you will be provided with a copy in the exam hall

    - Note: the sheet may change slightly over the course of the semester. Changes will be announced and the folder will always show the most up-to-date version.
