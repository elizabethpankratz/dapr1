## Week's Learning Objectives
1. Understand the difference between a population parameter and a sample statistic.
2. Understand the concept and construction of sampling distributions. 
3. Understand the effect of sample size on the sampling distribution.
4. Understand how to quantify the variability of a sample statistic and sampling distribution (standard error).

## Concepts to carry forward

+ Data can be of different types.

--

+ We can assign probabilities to outcomes of random experiments

--

+ We can define a probability distribution that describes the probability of all possible events.

--

+ Dependent on type (continuous vs. discrete), we can visualise and describe the distribution of data differently.


---
## Why are These Concepts Relevant to Psych Stats?

+ In psychology, we design a study, measure variables, and use these measurements to calculate a value that carries some meaning.
    + E.g., the difference in reaction times between groups

--

+ Given it has meaning based on the study design, we want to know something about the value:
    + Is it unusual or not?
    + This is the focus throughout the next semester. 

--

+ **Today:**
    + We will talk about populations, samples, and sampling.
    + Basic concepts of sampling may seem simple and intuitive.
    + These concepts will be very useful when we start talking about _statistical inference_, or how we make decisions about data.

---
## Populations vs Samples
+ In statistics, we often refer to populations and samples
    + **Population:** The entire group of people about whom you'd like to make inferences
    + **Sample:** The subset of the population from whom you will collect data to make these inferences

--

+ To get the most accurate measure of our variable, it would be ideal to collect data from the entire population; however, this is not feasible.

--

+ In almost all cases, researchers need to collect data from samples and use these results to make inferences about the population
  + The population value of the variable of interest is known as a **population parameter**
  + The sample value of the variable of interest is known as a **sample statistic**, or **point-estimate**

---
## Populations vs Samples - Notation

.pull-left[
+ It's important to know that although you may have seen these different types of notation used interchangeably in the past, they are actually slightly different when one is referring to a _population_ versus a _sample_:

|Population | Parameter         | Sample   |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| $\mu$     | Mean              | $\bar{x}$|

## Populations vs Samples - Example

+ Suppose I wanted to know the proportion of UG students at the University of Edinburgh who are permanent Scottish residents.

```{r, echo = F, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/PopulationMetric.png')
```
]

> **Test your Understanding:** What is the population in this example?

--

> What is the variable of interest?

--

> What is the parameter?

---
## Populations vs Samples - Example
+ How can we collect this information? 

--

  + We could send out an email requesting all students to provide their permanent residence...but it's not likely that all students will respond. 

--

  + We could ask instructors to collect this data from students in their classes, but not every student will attend each class, and not every instructor will comply.

--

- Even with this relatively small, accessible population, it's unlikely we can collect information from every single member.

---
## Populations vs Samples - Example

- Instead, we have to use the data from students who _do_ respond to make inferences about the overall student population

## Parameters, point-estimates, and sampling distributions

.pull-left[
+ It is the population parameter (proportion of UoE students who are permanent Scottish residents) we are interested in. This is a *true* value of the world.

+ We can draw a sample, and calculate this proportion in the sample.
  + The point-estimate from the sample is our best guess at the population parameter.

## 2021/22 actual proportion

.pull-left[
+ Let's use real data from 21/22 to demonstrate this concept

  + These data represent the entire student body from 21/22

+ Using these data, we can:

  1) Simulate gathering multiple samples of UoE students
  
  2) Calculate the proportion of each sample born in Scotland
  
  3) Produce a frequency distribution of each sample's proportions.

  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),

--

+ Each sampling distribution is characterising the _sampling variability_ in our estimate of the parameter of interest

- We've been taking samples of 10 students. Let's see what happens when we increase our sample size to $n = 50$, and then $n = 100$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=3.75, fig.width=7}

N <- 50
sampProps$Sample2 <- replicate(B, prop.table(table(sample(Edinburgh$Scottish, size = N, replace = TRUE)))[2])

N <- 100
sampProps$Sample3 <- replicate(B, prop.table(table(sample(Edinburgh$Scottish, size = N, replace = TRUE)))[2])

sampPropsLong <- reshape2::melt(sampProps)

meanDat <- data.frame(variable = c('Sample1', 'Sample2', 'Sample3'), Z = c(mean(sampProps$Sample1, na.rm = T), mean(sampProps$Sample2, na.rm = T), mean(sampProps$Sample3, na.rm = T)))

group_names <- list(
  'Sample1'="1000 Samples of 10",
  'Sample2'="1000 Samples of 50",
  'Sample3'="1000 Samples of 100"
)

sample_labeller <- function(variable,value){
  return(group_names[value])
}


z <- sampPropsLong %>%
  ggplot(., aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1), colour='gray', fill=baseColor) +
  labs(x='Proportion of Permanent Scottish Residents', y='Frequency') + xlim(0, .75) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.30, color = "red", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, labeller = sample_labeller) +
  geom_vline(data = meanDat, aes(xintercept = Z), color = '#FCBB06', size = 1) +

+ **What changes as we increase sample size?**

---
## Properties of sampling distributions
+ Sampling distributions are characterising the variability in sample estimates.
    - Variability can be thought of as the spread in data/plots.

--

+ So as we increase $n$, we get less variable samples (the distribution of sample statistics is more tightly clustered around the population parameter. 

  + Harder to get an unrepresentative sample as your $n$ increases).

--

+ Let's put this phenomenon in the language of probability: 

  + As sample $n$ increases, the probability of observing a point-estimate that is a long way from the population parameter (here 0.30) decreases (becomes less probable).

--

+ So when we have large samples, the point-estimates from those samples are likely to be closer to the population value.

---
## Standard error
- We can formally calculate the variability of a sampling distribution, or the **standard error**

$$SE=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

--

- This is essentially calculating the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, with a key difference:
      - The standard deviation describes the variability _within_ one sample
      - The standard error describes variability _across_ multiple samples.
      
--

+ With continuous data, the standard error gives you a sense of how different $\bar{x}$ is likely to be from $\mu$

--

+ In this example, we're working with binomial data (Scottish Residency = Yes or No), the standard error indicates how greatly a particular sample proportion is likely to differ from the proportion in the population. 

---
## Properties of sampling distributions

.pull-left[
- Mean of the sampling distribution is close to $\mu$, even with a small number of samples.

- As the number of samples increases:

  + The sampling distribution approaches a normal distribution.
  + Sample $\bar{x}$s pile up around $\mu$

## Two Related Concepts

+ These properties illustrate two important concepts:

+ **The Law of Large Numbers:** As $n$ increases, $\bar{x}$ approaches $\mu$

--

+ **Central Limit Theorem:** When estimates of $\bar{x}$ are based on increasingly large samples ( $n$ ), the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ becomes more normal (symmetric), and narrower (quantified by the standard error).

--

+ These concepts hold regardless of the underlying shape of the distribution

+ To demonstrate this, let's explore some different distributions.

## Central Limit Theorem

+ These examples all demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem
+ When $n$ is large enough, $\bar{x}s$ approximate a normal distribution around $\mu$, regardless of the underlying population distribution

## Features of samples
- Is our sample...
    - Biased?
    - Representative?
    - Random?

--

- If a sample of $n$ is drawn at random, it is likely to be unbiased and representative of $N$

- Our point estimates from such samples will be good guesses at the population parameter.

---
## Summary of today
- Samples are used to estimate the population. 
- Samples provide point estimates of population parameters. 
- Properties of samples and sampling distributions.
- Properties of good samples.

## Next tasks
 
+ This week:
  + Complete your lab
  + Come to office hours (last chance of the semester!)
      + Monica's are TODAY from 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm in 7 George Square, Room UG44
      + Umberto's are by appointment
      
+ Please complete the mid-course feedback form available at [this link](https://forms.office.com/e/bJc7P17Va1)

+ No Quiz this week
  + Instead, your group must submit Formative Report B by **12 noon on Friday 1st December**
 
+ Next Week (Week 12):
  + No lectures on Monday and Tuesday
  + Labs will still take place
  + In the labs: 
      (a) check the feedback given to your formative report submission;
      (b) study the example solutions that will be posted; 
      (c) ask questions to the tutors if anything is unclear in there
