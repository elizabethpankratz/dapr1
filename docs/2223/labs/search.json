Navigators are responsible for commenting on the strategy, code, and spotting typos or fixing errors. Each week you will rotate so that everyone experiences being a driver.\nDriver: open an Rmd file, and start writing your work there.\n\nNavigators: be alert and start providing suggestions and comments on the strategy and code.\n\nFormat\n\nPDF file, max 4 sides of A4 paper, keep the default settings in terms of Rmd knitting font and page margins.\nAppendix with all the code in a code chunk with the option results='hide'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Lab help and support\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lab is structured to provide various levels of support. When attending the labs, you should directly attempt and work on the tasks. However, if you are unsure or stuck at any point, you can make use of the following help:\n\nSimply raise your hand and get help from a tutor\nHover your mouse on the superscript number to get a hint. The hints may sometimes show multiple equivalent ways of getting an answer - you just need one way\nScroll down to the Worked Example section, where you can read through a worked example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution: Did you register for RStudio Server Online?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

The report should not include any reference to R code or functions, but be written or a generic reader who is only assumed to have a basic statistical understanding without any R knowledge. You should also avoid any R code output or printout in the PDF file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiding R code or ouput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiding R code\nHiding R output\nHiding R code and output\n\n\n\nTo not show the code of an R code chunk, and only show the output, write:\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n# code goes here\n```\n\n\nTo show the code of an R code chunk, but hide the output, write:\n```{r, results='hide'}\n# code goes here\n```\n\n\nTo hide both code and output of an R code chunk, write:\n```{r, include=FALSE}\n# code goes here\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Data\nHollywood Movies. At the link https://uoepsy.github.io/data/hollywood_movies_subset.csv you will find data on Hollywood movies released between 2012 and 2018 from the top 5 lead studios and top 10 genres. The following variables were recorded:\n\n\nMovie: Title of the movie\n\nLeadStudio: Primary U.S. distributor of the movie\n\nRottenTomatoes: Rotten Tomatoes rating (critics)\n\nAudienceScore: Audience rating (via Rotten Tomatoes)\n\nGenre: One of Action Adventure, Black Comedy, Comedy, Concert, Documentary, Drama, Horror, Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller, or Western\n\nTheatersOpenWeek: Number of screens for opening weekend\n\nOpeningWeekend: Opening weekend gross (in millions)\n\nBOAvgOpenWeekend: Average box office income per theater, opening weekend\n\nBudget: Production budget (in millions)\n\nDomesticGross: Gross income for domestic (U.S.) viewers (in millions)\n\nWorldGross: Gross income for all viewers (in millions)\n\nForeignGross: Gross income for foreign viewers (in millions)\n\nProfitability: WorldGross as a percentage of Budget\n\nOpenProfit: Percentage of budget recovered on opening weekend\n\nYear: Year the movie was released\n\nIQ1-IQ50: IQ score of each of 50 audience raters\n\nSnacks: How many of the 50 audience raters brought snacks\n\nPrivateTransport: How many of the 50 audience raters reached the cinema via private transportation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor formative report A, please only focus on the variables Movie to Year, ignoring anything beyond that. In other words, do not analyse the variables IQ1 to PrivateTransport in the next five weeks of the course. We will use those later in the course.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Tasks\nFor formative report A, you will be asked to perform the following tasks, each related to a week of teaching in this course:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: This week’s task\n\n\n\nA1) Read the data into R, inspect it, and write a concise introduction to the data and its structure\n\n\nA2) Display and describe the categorical data\nA3) Display and describe the numerical data\nA4) Display and describe a relationship of interest between two or three variables of your choice\nA5) Finish the report write-up, knit to PDF, and submit the PDF for formative feedback\nThis week you will only focus on task A1. Below there are some guided sub-steps you may want to consider to complete task A1.\n\n2.3 A1 sub-tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo see the hints, hover your cursor on the superscript numbers.\n\n\n\nRead the movie data into R, and give it a useful name. Inspect the data by looking at the data in RStudio. By viewing, we actually mean looking at the data either on the viewer or the console.1\nHow many observations are there?2\nHow many variables are there?3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does dim(DATA) return?\nWhat is the function of appending a [1] or [2]?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the type of each variable?4\nWhat’s the minimum and maximum budget in the sample? What about the average Rotten Tomatoes rating?5\nDo you notice any issues when computing the minimum and maximum Budget and the average RottenTomatoes rating?6\nWhat is the range (i.e. minimum and maximum) of the variables in the data? What about the number of missing values for each variable?7\nWrite-up a description of the dataset for the reader. You don’t need to show the actual data in the report, but a description in words is sufficient for the reader."

The data contains measurements for a total of 157 parties on four numeric variables: size of the bill (in dollars), size of the tip, number of guests in the group, and tip as a percentage of the bill total. The data also includes three categorical variables indicating whether or not the party paid with a credit card, the day of the week, as well as a server-specific identifier.\n\n\n\nsummary(tips)\n\n      Bill            Tip            Credit              Guests     \n Min.   : 1.66   Min.   : 0.250   Length:157         Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:15.19   1st Qu.: 2.075   Class :character   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Median :20.22   Median : 3.340   Mode  :character   Median :2.000  \n Mean   :22.73   Mean   : 3.807                      Mean   :2.096  \n 3rd Qu.:28.84   3rd Qu.: 5.000                      3rd Qu.:2.000  \n Max.   :70.51   Max.   :15.000                      Max.   :7.000  \n                 NA's   :1                                          \n     Day               Server              PctTip      \n Length:157         Length:157         Min.   :  6.70  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.: 14.30  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median : 16.20  \n                                       Mean   : 17.89  \n                                       3rd Qu.: 18.20  \n                                       Max.   :221.00  \n                                                       \n\n\n\n\nsummary returns a quick summary of the data.\nYou probably won’t understand some parts of the output above, but we will learn more in the coming weeks, so don’t worry too much about it. For the moment, you should be able to understand the minimum, maximum, and the mean.\nCurrently, it is not showing very informative output for the categorical variables.\nWe can replace each factor level with a clearer label:\n\ntips$Day <- factor(tips$Day, \n                   levels = c(\"m\", \"t\", \"w\", \"th\", \"f\"),\n                   labels = c(\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\"))\n\ntips$Credit <- factor(tips$Credit, \n                      levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                      labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n\ntips$Server <- factor(tips$Server)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing tidyverse, the function mutate is used to mutate a variable (column) in the data:\n\ntips <- tips %>%\n    mutate(\n        Day = factor(Day,\n                     levels = c(\"m\", \"t\", \"w\", \"th\", \"f\"),\n                     labels = c(\"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \"Thursday\", \"Friday\")),\n        Credit = factor(Credit,\n                        levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                        labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")),\n        Server = factor(Server)\n    )\n\nThe functions %>% and mutate are part of the tidyverse package. The former, %>%, is called pipe.\nThe pipe works by taking what’s on the left and passing it to the operation on the right. For example, rounding to 2 decimal places the logarithm of the whole numbers from 1 to 10:\n\nround(log(1:10), digits = 2)\n\n [1] 0.00 0.69 1.10 1.39 1.61 1.79 1.95 2.08 2.20 2.30\n\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n1:10 %>%\n    log() %>%\n    round(digits = 2)\n\n [1] 0.00 0.69 1.10 1.39 1.61 1.79 1.95 2.08 2.20 2.30\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s check the result of the changes to the variable types:\n\nglimpse(tips)\n\nRows: 157\nColumns: 7\n$ Bill   <dbl> 23.70, 36.11, 31.99, 17.39, 15.41, 18.62, 21.56, 19.58, 23.59, …\n$ Tip    <dbl> 10.00, 7.00, 5.01, 3.61, 3.00, 2.50, 3.44, 2.42, 3.00, 2.00, 1.…\n$ Credit <fct> No, No, Yes, Yes, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, N…\n$ Guests <dbl> 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 5, 5, …\n$ Day    <fct> Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday,…\n$ Server <fct> A, B, A, B, B, A, B, A, A, B, B, A, B, B, B, B, C, C, C, C, C, …\n$ PctTip <dbl> 42.2, 19.4, 15.7, 20.8, 19.5, 13.4, 16.0, 12.4, 12.7, 10.7, 11.…\n\n\n\nsummary(tips)\n\n      Bill            Tip         Credit        Guests             Day    \n Min.   : 1.66   Min.   : 0.250   No :106   Min.   :1.000   Monday   :20  \n 1st Qu.:15.19   1st Qu.: 2.075   Yes: 51   1st Qu.:2.000   Tuesday  :13  \n Median :20.22   Median : 3.340             Median :2.000   Wednesday:62  \n Mean   :22.73   Mean   : 3.807             Mean   :2.096   Thursday :36  \n 3rd Qu.:28.84   3rd Qu.: 5.000             3rd Qu.:2.000   Friday   :26  \n Max.   :70.51   Max.   :15.000             Max.   :7.000                 \n                 NA's   :1                                                \n Server     PctTip      \n A:60   Min.   :  6.70  \n B:65   1st Qu.: 14.30  \n C:32   Median : 16.20  \n        Mean   : 17.89  \n        3rd Qu.: 18.20  \n        Max.   :221.00  \n                        \n\n\n\n\nAfter making categorical variables factors, summary shows the count of each category for the categorical variables.\nThe percentage of total bill has a maximum value of 221, which seems very strange. Someone is very unlikely to tip more than their bill total. In this case 221% of their bill value seems unlikely.\nLet’s inspect the row where PctTip is greater than 100:\n\ntips[tips$PctTip > 100, ]\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n   Bill   Tip Credit Guests Day      Server PctTip\n  <dbl> <dbl> <fct>   <dbl> <fct>    <fct>   <dbl>\n1  49.6    NA Yes         4 Thursday C         221\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, using tidyverse, the function filter is used to only filter the rows that satisfy a condition:\n\ntips %>% \n    filter(PctTip > 100)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n   Bill   Tip Credit Guests Day      Server PctTip\n  <dbl> <dbl> <fct>   <dbl> <fct>    <fct>   <dbl>\n1  49.6    NA Yes         4 Thursday C         221\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a bill of 49.59, the tip would be 109.59 dollars:\n\n49.59 * 221 / 100\n\n[1] 109.5939\n\n\nFurthermore, we also notice that the tipping amount is not available (NA). The corresponding value in the percentage of total tip seems likely an inputting error, perhaps due to double typing the leading 2 when recording the data. We will set that value to not available (NA) with the following code:\n\ntips$PctTip[tips$PctTip > 100] <- NA\n\n\n\na > b tests whether a is greater than b. a < b tests whether a is smaller than b. a == b tests whether a is equal to b; notice the double equal sign! You can also use >= or <=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can use tidyverse:\n\ntips <- tips %>%\n    mutate(\n        PctTip = ifelse(PctTip > 100, NA, PctTip)\n    )\n\nWhere the function ifelse selects a value depending on a condition to test: ifelse(test, value_if_true, value_if_false). In the case above, each value in the column PctTip is replaced by NA if Pct > 100, and it is kept the same otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nsummary(tips)\n\n      Bill            Tip         Credit        Guests             Day    \n Min.   : 1.66   Min.   : 0.250   No :106   Min.   :1.000   Monday   :20  \n 1st Qu.:15.19   1st Qu.: 2.075   Yes: 51   1st Qu.:2.000   Tuesday  :13  \n Median :20.22   Median : 3.340             Median :2.000   Wednesday:62  \n Mean   :22.73   Mean   : 3.807             Mean   :2.096   Thursday :36  \n 3rd Qu.:28.84   3rd Qu.: 5.000             3rd Qu.:2.000   Friday   :26  \n Max.   :70.51   Max.   :15.000             Max.   :7.000                 \n                 NA's   :1                                                \n Server     PctTip     \n A:60   Min.   : 6.70  \n B:65   1st Qu.:14.30  \n C:32   Median :16.15  \n        Mean   :16.59  \n        3rd Qu.:18.05  \n        Max.   :42.20  \n        NA's   :1      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample writeup\n\n\n\nThe average bill size was $22.73, and the average tip was $3.85, corresponding to roughly 17% of the total bill. Out of 157 parties, only 51 paid with a credit card. Most parties tended to be of around 2 people each, and people tended to go to that restaurant more often on Wednesday. Among the three servers, server C was the one that served the least number of parties. The data also included a missing tipping value, corresponding to a bill $49.59, and a data inputting error for the corresponding measure of the tip as a percentage of the total bill."

The result of the above computation was only printed to the screen but not stored.\n\ntoy_data\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n     id   age course height\n  <int> <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n1     1    18 A         171\n2     2    20 B         180\n3     3    25 A         168\n4     4    22 B         193\n5     5    19 A         174\n\n\nTo store it, we need to assign the result:\n\ntoy_data <- toy_data %>%\n    select(id:course)\n\n\ntoy_data\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n     id   age course\n  <int> <dbl> <chr> \n1     1    18 A     \n2     2    20 B     \n3     3    25 A     \n4     4    22 B     \n5     5    19 A     \n\n\nBy doing the above, we have overwritten the data stored in toy_data with the selected columns.\n\n\n\n\nOverwrite the data to only include the first 15 variables (i.e. columns).2\nCreate a plot displaying the frequency distribution of movie genres.3\n\n\nCreate a plot displaying the frequency distribution of the lead studios.4\nWould it make sense to create a plot of the frequency distribution of movie names?5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore applying a function to your data, you should always ask yourself if what you are about to do is going to convey any insight about the data, compared to just looking at the data itself.\nThe goal of data analysis is to to go from a multitude of values to insights that provide actionable information from a quick glance.\n\n\n\nDescribe the distribution of movie genres. You may want to include both the frequency and the percentage frequency.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this code:\n\ntoy_data %>%\n    count(course) %>%\n    mutate(\n        perc = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2)\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  course     n  perc\n  <chr>  <int> <dbl>\n1 A          3    60\n2 B          2    40\n\n\nYou can change the names of the frequency from n to Freq and perc to Perc using:\n\ntoy_data %>%\n    count(course, name = \"Freq\") %>%\n    mutate(\n        Perc = round(Freq / sum(Freq) * 100, 2)\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  course  Freq  Perc\n  <chr>  <int> <dbl>\n1 A          3    60\n2 B          2    40\n\n\nAn alternative to the above involves using the group_by(), summarise(), and n() functions from tidyverse. The n() function counts the number of values, and we use it inside summarise() because we are summarising the data with a number. Before summarise, we use group_by(course) to tell R to do the computation for each unique course entry, i.e. for each group of rows defined by course.\n\ntoy_data %>%\n    group_by(course) %>%\n    summarise(\n        Freq = n()\n    ) %>%\n    mutate(\n        Perc = round(Freq / sum(Freq) * 100, 2)\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  course  Freq  Perc\n  <chr>  <int> <dbl>\n1 A          3    60\n2 B          2    40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most common genre and the most common lead studio?7"

    "text": "2 A first look at RStudio\nOkay, now you should have RStudio and a project open, and you should see something which looks more or less like the image below, where there are several little windows.\n\nWe are going to explore what each of these little windows offer by just diving in and starting to do things.\n\n2.1 R as a calculator\nStarting in the left-hand window, you’ll notice the blue sign > which is where we R code gets executed.\nType 2+2, and hit Enter ↵. You should discover that R is a calculator.\nLet’s work through some of the basic operations (adding, subtracting, etc). Try these commands yourself:\n\n2 + 5\n10 - 4\n2 * 5\n10 - (2 * 5)\n(10 - 2) * 5\n10 / 2\n\n3^2 (Hint, interpret the ^ symbol as “to the power of”)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever you see the blue sign >, it means R is ready and waiting for you to provide a command.\nIf you type 10 + and press Enter, you’ll see that instead of a blue > you are left with a blue +. This means that R is waiting for more. Either give it more, or cancel the command by pressing the escape key on your keyboard.\n\n\n\nAs well as performing calculations, we can ask R things, such as “Is 3 less than 5?”:\n\n3 < 5\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAs the computation above returns TRUE, we notice that such questions return either TRUE or FALSE. These are not numbers and are called logical values.\nTry the following:\n\n\n3 > 5 “is 3 greater than 5?”\n\n3 <= 5 “is 3 less than or equal to 5?”\n\n3 >= 3 “is 3 greater than or equal to 3?”\n\n3 == 5 “is 3 equal to 5?”\n\n(2 * 5) == 10 “is 2 times 5 equal to 10?”\n\n(2 * 5) != 11 “is 2 times 5 NOT equal to 11?”\n\n2.2 R as a calculator with a memory\nWe can also store things in R’s memory, and to do that we just need to give them a name. Type x <- 5 and press Enter.\nWhat has happened? We’ve just stored something named x which has the value 5. We can now refer to the name and it will give us the value! Try typing x and hitting Enter. It should give you the number 5. What about x * 3?\n:::{.callout-info} #### Storing things in R\nThe <- symbol, pronounced arrow, is used to assign a value to a named object:\n[name] <- [value]\nNote, there are a few rules about names in R:\n\nNo spaces - spaces inside a name are not allowed (the spaces around the <- don’t matter):\n\n\nlucky_number <- 5 ✔   lucky number <- 5 ❌\n\n\n\nNames must start with a letter:\n\n\nlucky_number <- 5 ✔   1lucky_number <- 5 ❌\n\n\n\nCase sensitive:\n\n\nlucky_number is different from Lucky_Number\n\n\n\nReserved words - there is a set of words you can’t use as names, including: if, else, for, in, TRUE, FALSE, NULL, NA, NaN, function\n(Don’t worry about remembering these, R will tell you if you make the mistake of trying to name a variable after one of these).\n\nYou might have noticed that something else happened when you executed the code x <- 5. The thing we named x with a value of 5 suddenly appeared in the top-right window. This is known as the environment, and it shows everything that we store things in R:\n\nWe’ve now used a couple of the windows - we’ve been executing R code in the console, and learned about how we can store things in R’s memory (the environment) by assigning a name to them:\n\nNotice that in the screenshot above, we have moved the console down to the bottom-left, and introduced a new window above it. This is the one that we’re going to talk about next."

We can have one document which contains all of our analysis as well as our written text, and can be compiled into a nicely formatted report. This saves us doing analysis in R and copying results across to Microsoft Word. It ensures our report accurately reflects our analysis. Everything that you’re reading now has all been written in Rmarkdown!\nWe’re going to use Rmarkdown documents throughout this course. We’ll get into it how to write them lower down, but it basically involves writing normal text interspersed with “code-chunks” (i.e., chunks of code!). In the example below, you can see the grey boxes indicating the R code, with text in between. We can then compile the document into either a .pdf or a .html file."

You may have to wait a while.\n\nIf you are using rstudio.ppls.ed.ac.uk, then we have already installed “tidyverse” and a few other useful packages for you, so you don’t have to do anything!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nOpen a new Rmarkdown document: File > New File > R Markdown…\nWhen the box pops-up, give a title of your choice (“Intro lab”, maybe?) and your name as the author.\n\n\n\n7.1 Writing code in a .Rmd file\nThe file which you have just created will have some template stuff in it. Delete everything below the first code chunk to start with a fresh document:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nInsert a new code chunk by either using the Insert button in the top right of the document and selecting R, or by typing Ctrl + Alt + i on Windows or Option + Cmd + i on MacOS.\nInside the chunk, type:\nprint(\"Hello world! My name is ?\")\nTo execute the code inside the chunk, you can either:\n\ndo as you did in the R script - put the text-cursor on the first line, and hit Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to run the lines sequentially;\nclick the little green arrow at the top right of your code-chunk to run all of the code inside the chunk;\nwhile your cursor is inside the code chunk, press Cmd + Shift + Enter to run all of the code inside the chunk.\n\nYou can see that the output gets printed below.\n\n\n\nWe’re going to use some functions which are in the tidyverse package, which we already installed above (or which we installed for you on the server).\nTo use the package, we need to load it.\nWhen writing analysis code, we want it to be reproducible - we want to be able to give somebody else our code and the data, and ensure that they can get the same results. To do this, we need to show what packages we use.\nIt is good practice to load any packages you use at the top of your code, so that users of your code will know what packages they will need to install to run your code.\nIn your first code chunk, type:\n\n# I'm going to use these packages in this document:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nand run the chunk.\nNOTE: You might get various messages popping up below when you run this chunk, that is fine.\nComments in code\nNote that using # in R code makes that line a comment, which basically means that R will ignore the line. Comments are useful for you to remind yourself of what your code is doing.\n\n7.2 Writing text in a .Rmd file\nPlace your cursor outside the code chunk, and below the code chunk add a new line with the following:\n# R code examples\nNote that when the # is used in a Rmarkdown file outside of a code-chunk, it will make that line a heading when we finally get to compiling the document. Below, what you see on the left will be compiled to look like those on the right:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECALL:\n\n\n\n\n\nInside a code-chunk, one or more #s will create a comment\n\n\nOutside a code-chunk, one ore more #s will create headings\n\n\n\n\nIn your Rmarkdown document, choose a few of the symbols below, and write an explanation of what it does, giving an example in a code chunk. You can see an example of the first few below.\n\n+\n-\n*\n/\n()\n^\n<-\n<\n>\n<=\n>=\n==\n!=\n\n\n\n7.3 Storing data into R\nWe’ve already seen how to assign a value to a name/symbol using <-. However, we’ve only seen how to assign a single number, e.g, x <- 5.\nTo store a sequence of numbers into R, we combine the values using the combine function c() and give the sequence a name. A sequence of elements all of the same type is called a vector. To view the stored content, simply type the name of the vector.\n\nmyfirstvector <- c(1, 5, 3, 7)\nmyfirstvector\n\n[1] 1 5 3 7\n\n\nWe can perform arithmetic operations on each value of the vector. For example, to add five to each entry:\n\nmyfirstvector + 5\n\n[1]  6 10  8 12\n\n\nRecall that vectors are sequences of elements all of the same type. They do not have to be always numbers; they could be words such as real or fictional animals. Words need to be written inside quotations, e.g. “anything”, and instead of being of numeric type, we say they are characters.\n\nwordsvector <- c(\"cat\", \"dog\", \"parrot\", \"peppapig\")\nwordsvector\n\n[1] \"cat\"      \"dog\"      \"parrot\"   \"peppapig\"\n\n\n\nNOTE\nYou can use either double-quote or single-quote:\n\nc(\"cat\", \"dog\", \"parrot\", \"peppapig\")\n\n[1] \"cat\"      \"dog\"      \"parrot\"   \"peppapig\"\n\nc('cat', 'dog', 'parrot', 'peppapig')\n\n[1] \"cat\"      \"dog\"      \"parrot\"   \"peppapig\"\n\n\n\nThe function class() will tell you the type of the object. In this case, it is a character vector.\n\nclass(wordsvector)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIt does not make sense to add a number to words, hence some operations like addition and multiplication are only defined on vectors of numeric type. If you make a mistake, R will warn you with a red error message.\n\nwordsvector + 5\n\n\nError in wordsvector + 5 : non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\nFinally, it is important to notice that if you combine together in a vector a number and a word, R will transform all elements to be of the same type. Why? Recall: vectors are sequences of elements all of the same type. Typically, R chooses the most general type between the two. In this particular case, it would make everything a character, check the ““, as it would be harder to transform a word into a number!\n\nmysecondvector <- c(4, \"cat\")\nmysecondvector\n\n[1] \"4\"   \"cat\"\n\n\n\n7.4 Reading data into R\nWhile we can manually input data like we did above, more often, we will need to read in data which has been created elsewhere (like in excel, or by some software which is used to present participants with experiments).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nAdd a new heading by typing the following:\n# Reading and storing data\nRemember: We make headings using the # outside of a code chunk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nOpen Microsoft Excel, or LibreOffice Calc, or whatever spreadsheet software you have available to you, and create some data with more than one variable.\nIt can be whatever you want, but we’ve used a very small example here for you to follow, so feel free to use it if you like.\nWe’ve got two sets of values here: the names and the birth-years of each member of the Beatles. The easiest way to think of this would be to have a row for each Beatle, and a column for each of name and birth-year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nSave the data as a .csv file.\nAlthough R can read data when it’s saved in Microsoft/LibreOffice formats, the simplest, and most universal way to save data is as simple text, with the values separated by some character - .csv stands for comma separated values.\nIn Microsoft Excel, if you go to File > Save as\nIn the Save as Type box, choose to save the file as CSV (Comma delimited).\nImportant: save your data in the project folder you created at the start of this lab.\n\n\nBack in RStudio…\nNext, we’re going to read the data into R. We can do this by using the read_csv() function, and directing it to the file you just saved.\nIf you are using RStudio on the server, you will need to upload the file you just saved to the server. The video below shows an example of this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nCreate a new code-chunk in your Rmarkdown and, in the chunk, type: read_csv(\"name-of-your-data.csv\"), where you replace name-of-your-data with whatever you just saved your data as in your spreadsheet software.\n\n\nHelpful tip\nIf you have your text-cursor inside the quotation marks, and press the tab key on your keyboard, it will show you the files inside your project. You can then use the arrow keys to choose between them and press Enter to add the code:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run the line of code you just wrote, it will print out the data, but will not store it. To do that, we need to assign it as something:\n\n\n\n\nbeatles <- read_csv(\"data_from_excel.csv\")\n\nNote that this will now turn up in the Environment pane of RStudio.\nNow that we’ve got our data in R, we can print it out by simply invoking its name:\n\nbeatles\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  name   birth_year\n  <chr>       <dbl>\n1 John         1940\n2 Paul         1942\n3 George       1943\n4 Ringo        1940\n\n\nAnd we can do things such as ask R how many rows and columns there are:\n\ndim(beatles)\n\n[1] 4 2\n\n\nThis says that there are 4 members of the Beatles, and for each we have 2 measurements.\nTo get more insight into what the data actually are, you can either use the structure str() function, or glimpse() function to get a glimpse at the data:\n\nstr(beatles)\n\nspec_tbl_df [4 × 2] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ name      : chr [1:4] \"John\" \"Paul\" \"George\" \"Ringo\"\n $ birth_year: num [1:4] 1940 1942 1943 1940\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   name = col_character(),\n  ..   birth_year = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=<externalptr> \n\nglimpse(beatles)\n\nRows: 4\nColumns: 2\n$ name       <chr> \"John\", \"Paul\", \"George\", \"Ringo\"\n$ birth_year <dbl> 1940, 1942, 1943, 1940\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nUse dim() to confirm how many rows and columns are in your data.\nUse str() or glimpse() to take a look at the structure of the data. Don’t worry about the output of str() right now, we’ll pick up with this in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n7.5 Getting help in R\ndim(), str(), read_csv() are all functions.\nFunctions perform specific operations / transformations in computer programming.\nThey can have inputs and outputs. For example, dim() takes some data you have stored in R as its input, and gives the dimensions of the data as its output.\nIn R, functions come with help pages, where you can see information about the various inputs and outputs, and examples of how to use them.\nIn the console, type ?dim (or ?dim() will work too) and press Enter.\nThe bottom-right pane (where things like plots are also shown), should switch to the Help tab, and open the documentation page for the dim() function!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did we ask you to write this bit in the console, whereas previously we’ve been writing stuff in the RMarkdown document in the editor?\nWell, when writing an RMarkdown document, the aim at the end is to have a nice document which we can read. For instance, we can write statistical reports, journal papers, coursework reports etc, in Rmarkdown. But the reader doesn’t need to see that we’re looking up how to use some function - just like they don’t need to know that we might look up a word in the dictionary before using it.\n\n\n\n\n7.6 Compiling a .Rmd file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nBy now, you should have an Rmardkown document (.Rmd) with your answers to the tasks we’ve been through today.\nCompile the document by clicking on the Knit button at the top (it will ask you to save your document first). The little arrow to the right of the Knit button allows you to compile to either .pdf or .html."

In this lab, we’re going to focus on describing and visualising distributions of categorical data.\nThe graph showing the distribution of a variable shows us where the values are centred, how the values vary, and gives some information about where a typical value might fall.

This is known as a measure of central tendency. For numeric data, we can use measures such as the mean, which you will likely have heard of. For nominal data (unordered categorical data), however, our only option is to use the mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\nThe most frequent value (the value that occurs the greatest number of times).\n\n\n\nIn our case, the mode is the “Cognitive Neuroscience” category.\nRelative frequencies\nWe might alternatively want to show the percentage of respondents in each category, rather than the raw frequencies.\nThe percentages show the relative frequency distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative frequency distribution\nA relative frequency distribution shows the proportion of times each value occurs\n(contrast this with the frequency distribution which shows the number of times).\nRelative frequencies can be written as fractions, percents, or decimals.\n\n\n\nIn the object “freq_table”, we have a variable called n, which is the frequencies (the number in each category).\nThe total of this column is equal to the total number of respondents:\n\n# sum all the values in the \"n\" variable in the \"freq_table\" object\nsum(freq_table$n)\n\n[1] 74\n\n\nAnd therefore, each value in freq_table$n, divided by the total, is equal to the proportion in each category:\n( Tip: Proportions are percentages/100. So 0.4 is another way of expressing 40%)\n\n# take the values in the \"n\" variable from the \"freq_table\" object, \n# and divide by the sum of all the values in the \"n\" variable in \"freq_table\"\nfreq_table$n/sum(freq_table$n)\n\n[1] 0.3243243 0.1351351 0.2702703 0.1216216 0.1486486\n\n\nWe can then simply add the proportions as a new column to our table of frequencies by assigning the values we just calculated to a new variable:\n\n# the variable \"prop\" in the \"freq_table\" object is now assigned \n# the values we calculated above (the proportions)\nfreq_table$prop <- freq_table$n/sum(freq_table$n)\n\n# print the \"freq_table\" object\nfreq_table\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  area                       n  prop\n  <chr>                  <int> <dbl>\n1 Cognitive Neuroscience    24 0.324\n2 Developmental             10 0.135\n3 Differential              20 0.270\n4 Language                   9 0.122\n5 Social                    11 0.149\n\n\n However, we can also do this within a sequence of pipes (%>%). To do so, we use a new function called mutate().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmutate\n\n\n\nThe mutate() function is used to add or modify variables to data.\n\n# take the data\n# %>%\n# mutate it, such that there is a variable called \"newvariable\", which\n# has the values of a variable called \"oldvariable\" multiplied by two.\ndata %>%\n  mutate(\n    newvariable = oldvariable * 2\n  )\n\nNote: Inside mutate(), we don’t have to keep using the dollar sign $, as we have already told it what data to look for variables in.\nTo ensure that our additions/modifications of variables are stored in R’s environment (rather than simply printed out), we need to reassign the name of our dataframe:\n\ndata <- \n  data %>%\n  mutate(\n    newvariable = oldvariable * 2\n  )\n\n\n\nWe can actually add this step to our earlier code:\n\n# make a new object called \"freq_table\", and assign it:\n# the counts of values of \"area\" variable in \n# the psych_discipline dataframe.\n# from there, 'mutate' such that there is a variable called \"prop\" which\n# has the values of the \"n\" variable divided by the sum of the \"n\" variable.\nfreq_table <- \n  psych_disciplines %>%\n  count(area) %>%\n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n)\n  )\n\n# show the object called \"freq_table\"\nfreq_table\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  area                       n  prop\n  <chr>                  <int> <dbl>\n1 Cognitive Neuroscience    24 0.324\n2 Developmental             10 0.135\n3 Differential              20 0.270\n4 Language                   9 0.122\n5 Social                    11 0.149\n\n\nVisualising\n\n“By visualizing information, we turn it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes. A sort of information map. And when you’re lost in information, an information map is kind of useful.”_ David McCandless\n\nWe’re going to now make our first steps into the world of data visualisation. R is an incredibly capable language for creating visualisations of almost any kind. It is used by many media companies (e.g., the BBC), and has the capability of producing 3d visualisations, animations, interactive graphs, and more.\nWe are going to use the most popular R package for visualisation, ggplot2. This is actually part of the tidyverse, so if we have an Rmarkdown document and have loaded the tidyverse packages at the start (by using library(tidyverse)), then ggplot2 will be loaded too).\nRecall our frequency distribution table:\n\n# show the object called \"freq_table\"\nfreq_table\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  area                       n  prop\n  <chr>                  <int> <dbl>\n1 Cognitive Neuroscience    24 0.324\n2 Developmental             10 0.135\n3 Differential              20 0.270\n4 Language                   9 0.122\n5 Social                    11 0.149\n\n\nWe can plot these values as a bar chart:\n\nggplot(data = freq_table, aes(x = area, y = n)) +\n    geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot components\nNote the key components of the ggplot code.\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the x-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n\nThen we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (in our case, the columns/bars), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes().\n\n\n+ geom_col() Adds columns to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional - Different aes() and geoms, and labels\n\n\n\n\n\nUse these as reference for when you want to make changes to the plots you create.\nAdditionall, remember that google is your friend - there are endless forums with people asking how to do something in ggplot, and you can just copy and paste bits of code to add to your plots!\n\nFill the geoms:\n\n\nggplot(data = freq_table, aes(x = area, y = n, fill = area)) +\n    geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the axis labels:\n\n\nggplot(data = freq_table, aes(x = area, y = n, fill = area)) +\n    geom_col()+\n    labs(title=\"Counts of respondents by sub-discipline\", y = \"Number of respondents\", x = \"Sub-discipline\")\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the geom:\n(Note that using geom_col had the y axis starting at 0, but geom_point starts just below the lowest value.\n\n\n# note that we also need to change \"fill = area\" to \"col = area\". \nggplot(data = freq_table, aes(x = area, y = n, col = area)) +\n    geom_point()+\n    labs(title=\"Counts of respondents by sub-discipline\", y = \"Number of respondents\", x = \"Sub-discipline\")\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the limits of the axes:\n\n\nggplot(data = freq_table, aes(x = area, y = n, fill = area)) +\n    geom_col()+\n    labs(title=\"Counts of respondents by sub-discipline\", y = \"Number of respondents\", x = \"Sub-discipline\")+\n    ylim(0,50)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove (or reposition) the legend:\n\n\n# setting legend.position as \"bottom\" would put it at the bottom!\n\nggplot(data = freq_table, aes(x = area, y = n, fill = area)) +\n    geom_col()+\n    labs(title=\"Counts of respondents by sub-discipline\", y = \"Number of respondents\", x = \"Sub-discipline\")+\n    ylim(0,50)+\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") \n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the theme:\n\n\n# there are many predefine themes, including: \n# theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_light()\n\nggplot(data = freq_table, aes(x = area, y = n, fill = area)) +\n    geom_col()+\n    labs(title=\"Counts of respondents by sub-discipline\", y = \"Number of respondents\", x = \"Sub-discipline\")+\n    ylim(0,50)+\n    theme_minimal()"

    "text": "4 Ordered Categorical (Ordinal) Data\nRecall that ordinal data is categorical data which has a natural ordering of the possible responses. One of the most common examples of ordinal data which you will encounter in psychology is the Likert Scale. You will probably have come across these before, perhaps when completing online surveys or questionnaires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikert Scale\nA five or seven point scale on which an individual express how much they agree or disagree with a particular statement.\n\n\n\nWith Likert data, there is a set of discrete response options (it is categorical data). The response options can be ranked, making it ordered categorical ( strongly disagree < disagree < neither < agree < strongly agree ). Importantly, the distance between responses is not measurable.\nFrequency table\nLet’s suppose that as well as collecting information on the sub-discipline of psychology they identified with, we also asked our respondents to rate their level of happiness from 1 to 5, as well as their job satisfaction from 1 to 5.\n\n\nVariable Name\nDescription\n\n\n\nparticipant\nSubject identifier\n\n\nhappiness\nRespondent’s level of happiness from 1 to 5\n\n\njob_sat\nRespondent’s level of job satisfaction from 1 to 5\n\n\n\n\npsych_survey <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/psych_survey2.csv\")\npsych_survey\n\n# A tibble: 74 × 3\n   participant   happiness job_sat\n   <chr>             <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 respondent_1          3       3\n 2 respondent_2          3       4\n 3 respondent_3          2       5\n 4 respondent_4          4       5\n 5 respondent_5          3       5\n 6 respondent_6          4       4\n 7 respondent_7          4       2\n 8 respondent_8          5       5\n 9 respondent_9          1       5\n10 respondent_10         3       4\n# … with 64 more rows\n\n\nFor these questions (variables happiness and job_sat), we could do the same thing as we did above for unordered categorical data, and summarise this into frequencies:\n\n# take the \"psych_survey\" dataframe %>%\n# count() the values in the \"happiness\" variable \npsych_survey %>%\n    count(happiness)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  happiness     n\n      <dbl> <int>\n1         1     6\n2         2    13\n3         3    27\n4         4    21\n5         5     7\n\n# take the \"psych_survey\" dataframe %>%\n# count() the values in the \"job_sat\" variable \npsych_survey %>%\n    count(job_sat)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  job_sat     n\n    <dbl> <int>\n1       1     3\n2       2     6\n3       3    11\n4       4    16\n5       5    38\n\n\nCentral tendency\nWe could again use the Mode - the most common value - to summarise this data. However, because the responses are ordered, it can be more useful to think about the percentages of respondents in and below/above each category. For instance, we might want to talk about asking which category has 50% of the observations in a lower category, and 50% of the observations in a higher category. This is mid-point is known as the Median.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian\nThe value for which 50% of observations a lower and 50% are higher. It is the mid-point of a list of ordered values.\nTo find the median:\n\nrank order the values\nfind the middle value:\n\nIf there are \\(n\\) values, find the value at position \\(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\).\n\nIf \\(n\\) is even, \\(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\) will not be a whole number.\nFor instance, if \\(n = 20\\), you are looking for the \\(\\frac{n+1}{2} = \\frac{20+1}{2} = 10.5^{th}\\) value.\n\nWhen calculating the median for ordinal data, if the \\(\\frac{n}{2}^{th}\\) and \\(\\frac{n+1}{2}^{th}\\) values are different, report both.\nWhen calculating the median for numeric data, report the midpoint of the \\(\\frac{n}{2}^{th}\\) and \\(\\frac{n+1}{2}^{th}\\) values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the previous lab we discussed how to tell R explicitly that a variable is of a certain type using functions such as as.factor(), as.numeric(), and so on.\nYou may notice that we haven’t done this yet with the data we have been working with in so far today:\n\n# inside the \"psych_survey\" dataframe, take ($) the \"happiness\" variable,\n# and tell me what type/class it is\nclass(psych_survey$happiness)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nThis is because there are some benefits to letting R think your data is numeric, even when it is not. It means we can use functions such as median() to quickly find the median:\n\n# inside the \"psych_survey\" dataframe, take ($) the \"happiness\" variable,\n# and find the median\nmedian(psych_survey$happiness)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution!\n\n\n\nWhile we can make R treat this data is numeric, it is important to remember that it is actually measured on an ordinal scale.\nFor example, if the median falls between levels, R will tell us that the median is the mid-point:\n\n# for the values 2,1,2,3,4,5, \n# find the median\nmedian(c(2,1,2,3,5,4))\n\n[1] 2.5\n\n\nBut because our data is ordinal, then we know that 2.5 is not a valid response.\n\n\nWe can also use functions such as min() and max() to find the minimum and maximum values:\n\n# inside the \"psych_survey\" dataframe, take ($) the \"happiness\" variable,\n# and find the minimum value\nmin(psych_survey$happiness)\n\n[1] 1\n\n# and find the maximum value\nmax(psych_survey$happiness)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nCumulative percentages, Quartiles\nIn calculating the median, we are going beyond talking about the relative frequencies (i.e., the percentage in each category), to talking about the cumulative percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative percentage\nCumulative percentages are another way of expressing a frequency distribution.\nThey are the successive addition of percentages in each category. For example, the cumulative percentage for the 3rd category is the percentage of respondents in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd category:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nFrequency count (n)\nRelative frequency (%)\nCumulative frequency\nCumulative percentage\n\n\n\nResponse 1\n10\n13.33\n10\n13.33\n\n\nResponse 2\n10\n13.33\n20\n26.67\n\n\nResponse 3\n20\n26.67\n40\n53.33\n\n\nResponse 4\n25\n33.33\n65\n86.67\n\n\nResponse 5\n10\n13.33\n75\n100.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw before how we can calculate the proportions/percentages in each category:\n( Note: We multiply by 100 here to turn the proportion into a percentage)\n\n# take the \"psych_survey\" dataframe %>%\n# count() the values in the \"happiness\" variable (creates an \"n\" column), and\n# from there, 'mutate' such that there is a variable called \"percent\" which\n# has the values of the \"n\" variable divided by the sum of the \"n\" variable.\npsych_survey %>%\n  count(happiness) %>%\n  mutate(\n    percent = n/sum(n)*100\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  happiness     n percent\n      <dbl> <int>   <dbl>\n1         1     6    8.11\n2         2    13   17.6 \n3         3    27   36.5 \n4         4    21   28.4 \n5         5     7    9.46\n\n\nWe can add another variable, and make it the cumulative percentage, by using the cumsum() function.\n\n# take the \"psych_survey\" dataframe %>%\n# count() the values in the \"happiness\" variable (creates an \"n\" column), and\n# from there, 'mutate' such that there is a variable called \"percent\" which\n# has the values of the \"n\" variable divided by the sum of the \"n\" variable,\n# and also make a variable called \"cumulative_percent\" which is the \n# successive addition of the values in the \"percent\" variable\npsych_survey %>% \n  count(happiness) %>% \n  mutate(\n    percent = n/sum(n)*100,\n    cumulative_percent = cumsum(percent)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  happiness     n percent cumulative_percent\n      <dbl> <int>   <dbl>              <dbl>\n1         1     6    8.11               8.11\n2         2    13   17.6               25.7 \n3         3    27   36.5               62.2 \n4         4    21   28.4               90.5 \n5         5     7    9.46             100   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about why this will not work:\n\npsych_survey %>% \n  count(happiness) %>% \n  mutate(\n    cumulative_percent = cumsum(percent),\n    percent = n/sum(n)*100\n  )\n\n\nError: object ‘percent’ not found\n\nAnswer: Inside the mutate() function, we are trying to assign the cumulative_percent variable based on the values of the percent variable. But in the code above, percent gets defined after cumulative_percent, and so it will not work. Hence the error message (“percent not found”).\n\n\n\nWhile the median splits the data in two (50% either side), you will often see data being split into four equal blocks.\nThe points which divide the four blocks are known as quartiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuartiles\nQuartiles are the points in rank-ordered data below which falls 25%, 50%, and 75% of the data.\n\nThe first quartile is the first category for which the cumulative percentage is \\(\\geq 25\\%\\).\n\nThe median is the first category for which the cumulative percentage is \\(\\geq 50\\%\\).\n\nThe third quartile is the first category for which the cumulative percentage is \\(\\geq 75\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at the quartiles, it gives us an idea of how spread out the data is.\nAs an example, if we had 10 categories A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and we knew that:\n\n\n\\(Q_1\\) (the \\(1^{st}\\) quartile) = G,\n\n\\(Q_2\\) (the \\(2^{nd}\\) quartile, the median) = H,\n\n\\(Q_3\\) (the \\(3^{rd}\\) quartile) = H,\n\nThis tells us that the first 25% of the data falls in one of the categories from A to G (quite a large range), the second 25% falls in categories G and H (a small range), and the third 25% of the data falls entirely in category H.\nSo a lot of the data is between G and H, with the data being more sparse in the lower and higher categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead to numeric data\nWe will talk about quartiles in numeric data too, where we commonly use the difference between the first and third quartile as a measure of how spread out the data are. This gets known as the inter-quartile range (IQR).\n\n\n\nVisualising\nWe can visualise ordered categorical data in the same way we did for unordered.\nFirst we save our frequencies/percentages as a new object:\n\nfreq_table2 <- psych_survey %>%\n  count(happiness) %>%\n  mutate(\n    percent = n/sum(n)*100\n  )\n\nThen we give that object to our ggplot code, with the appropriate aes() mappings:\n\n# make a ggplot with the object \"freq_table2\". \n# on the x axis put the possible values in the \"happiness\" variable,\n# on the y axis put the possible values in the \"n\" variable.\n# add columns for each entry in the data. \nggplot(data = freq_table2, aes(x = happiness, y = percent)) + \n  geom_col()"
